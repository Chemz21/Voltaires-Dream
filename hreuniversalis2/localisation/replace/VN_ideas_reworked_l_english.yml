 #Viviers
 VIV_idea_1_desc: "Starting with the Crusades against the Cathars, the Vivarais suffered from a lot of religious aggression and wars. With the outbreak of the Reformation, many people changed faith, influenced by the nearby located center of Genève. This caused again for troubles, mainly during the revolt of the Calvinists against Louis XVII, in which the important Vivarais city of Privas was burned to the ground. And when the Edict of Nantes was revoked by Louis XIV, the Dragonnades caused many non-Catholics to flee. The war of the Camisards, a revolt of Huguenots, caused even more damage."
 VIV_idea_2_desc: "The Haut-Vivarais is the highest part of the Vivarais, consisting of many grasslands and forests on rocky, old volcanic plateaus. It's a harsh environment, dry and rather windy during the summer, cold and snowy during the winter, and foggy during fall and spring. These lands have long been used by hardy shepherds."
 VIV_idea_4_desc: "Several local barons, like the one of Joannas, supported the Bishop in its sovereignty of the region, promising to help militarily if necessary. The Bishop also was constantly seeking to preserve the independence of Vivarais, and managed for example to regain lost lands from Toulouse. However, it remained very weak and couldn't compete against Lyon, Provence or France, and to make things worse, the emperor was too weak to guarantee our independence."
 VIV_idea_5_desc: "With the arrival of the Popes in Avignon in the early 14th century, the mulberry, whose leaves are eaten by the silk caterpillars, was introduced in the region. As it was sufficiently warm here to grow these plants, people started to cultivate their own silk, and the Vivarais became the most important silk-producing region of France. Because of a severe winter in 1709, the traditional production (olives and chestnuts) was destroyed, increasing the need to find other incomes like the sériculture.\nDuring the 1800s, the mulberry trees suffered from various diseases, and the imported seeds provided only a short-term solution. Eventually the diseases were under control, but it didn't avoid the collapse of this sector."
 VIV_idea_6_desc: "There are many fortified villages in the region, called Bastides. The rivers and the slopes made it even more difficult to capture the cities. Balazuc, Largentiere and Rochemaure are some examples of villages that could withstand sieges very well. All the buildings were almost completely built of stone, something most people in Europe could not afford; this made the villages very fire-proof."
 VIV_idea_7_desc: "The village of Largentière had been for a long time an important industrious town. It was known, and named after, its silver mines. These did not give pure silver, but provided galena (in French called silverized lead). Lead was long used to make bullets, and silver is a precious metal."
 #Mulhouse
 MUA_idea_1: "Solid Buildings with a Mill"
 MUA_idea_4: "Magnificent Gilded Palace"
 MUA_idea_6: "Pioneer of the Industrial Revolution in France"
 MUA_idea_7: "Resisted France"
 MUA_idea_7_desc: "Since Mulhouse left the Dekapolis in 1515 and joined the Swiss Confederation as an associate, the city was not annexed by Louis XIV's French reunion policy in 1673 and 1674. However, due to economic reasons Mulhouse voluntarily joined France in 1798."
 #Fleckenstein
 FXK_idea_1: "Upswing During the Staufer Period"
 FXK_idea_3: "United Home Region"
 FXK_idea_6_desc: "Alsace is known for its viticulture and its wine specialties. We should also create our own wine recipes."
 FXK_idea_7: "Well-Known Knights"
 FXK_idea_7_desc: "In the Thirty Years' War and shortly thereafter, three brothers of the Fleckenstein family became famous: Gottfried von Fleckenstein-Windeck fell during the siege of the city of Vesoul in 1639. His brother Georg Heinrich became general in the Bavarian army. The youngest brother, Friedrich Wolfgang, entered French service and was later appointed field marshal by Louis XIV."
 #Lichtenberg
 LTB_idea_1: "Alsatian Field of Tension"
 LTB_idea_3: "Town Privileges"
 LTB_idea_4_desc: "The Lichtenberg family pursued two goals in the 13th and 14th centuries: The better protection of their ancestral castle in Lichtenberg and the connection of their scattered territories to the left and right of the Rhine. The former was achieved by purchasing various castles in the vicinity of the ancestral castle, the latter only incompletely: The Lichtenberg estate could never grow together into a closed territory."
 LTB_idea_5: "Peace Within the Family"
 LTB_idea_7_desc: "Jakob and Ludwig, sons of Ludwig IV von Lichtenberg, were completely opposite characters. The older, Jakob von Lichtenberg, was particularly interested in science, astrology and alchemy."
 #Strassburg
 SSF_idea_2: "Fought for Independence"
 SSF_idea_5: "Center of Book Production"
 SSF_idea_5_desc: "After Johannes Gutenberg invented letterpress printing in Europe, Strassburg quickly became an important center of book production. The Strassburger printers made an important contribution to the spread of the Reformation, because thanks to the far-reaching religious tolerance of the city, the writings of Martin Luther and other reformers could be published here already early. One third of the writings printed in the 16th century were bibles or excerpts from them."
 #Alsace
 ALS_idea_1: "Influenced by Germanic and Romanesque Culture"
 ALS_idea_4_desc: "Pottery has been practiced in Alsace since the Renaissance, especially in Betschdorf and Soufflenheim. In Betschdorf remarkable pottery is offered, whose production technique has remained unchanged since 1717."
 #Wertheim
 WEE_idea_6_desc: "During the 3rd Würzburger feud Wertheim was besieged by the Würzburger bishop and surrounding villages were burned. After the defeat of Wertheim, our entire territory on the left bank of the Main was confiscated by Würzburg. Our troops will fight with more discipline from now on to prevent such impertinence in the future."
 #Darmstadt
 DSD_idea_2_desc: "In 1330, Emperor Louis the Bavarian granted Count Wilhelm I von Katzenelnbogen the city rights for Darmstadt. With the associated market rights, the importance of the previously rather inconspicuous settlement grew rapidly and the entire economy in the surrounding area focused on the Darmstadt market, while Darmstadt itself focused on the older and larger cities of Frankfurt, Worms and Speyer."
 DSD_idea_4_desc: "In the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, the Counts of Katzenelnbogen repeatedly extended and rebuilt the castle until it finally became a prestigious castle in the middle of the 15th century. Darmstadt became the Katzenelnbogener secondary residence and experienced a first high phase of its development."
 #Speyer
 BMS_idea_5_desc: "Speyergau was a county of the Salians, which extended to the surroundings of the city of Speyer. The Salians are considered the second founders of Speyer; with them the city moved into the center of imperial politics and became the spiritual center of Salian kingship. With the election of Conrad II as German King the targeted promotion of the city and church began, which was also continued by the Staufer family."
 #Speyer-Stadt
 Speyer_idea_1: "Drapery Trade"
 Speyer_idea_1_desc: "The main pillar of the economy was cloth production and trade, on which about 15% of the population depended. Taking into account ancillary industries that depended on cloth production, such as wool combers, spinners, walkers, dyers, the proportion was even higher. The cloth export went to the North and Baltic Sea, Silesia, Transylvania and Switzerland."
 Speyer_idea_4_desc: "The free imperial city of Speyer built up the Speyern Landwehr in 1410 as a supplement to its city wall, i.e. an advanced city fortification and the boundary of a part of the city area. Watchtowers were built on the roads to the neighbouring villages where they crossed the wall."
 #Hohenzollern
 ZLX_idea_7_desc: "The core realm of the County split at various times between Hechingen, Haigerloch, and Sigmaringen. Such Cadet branches will ensure our dynasty's stability."
 #Mantua
 MAN_idea_2_desc: "Our namesake city is defended by artificial lakes ultimately flowing from the Po River. By taking advantage of the river, we can increase our exports and expand foreign trade throughout Italy."
 MAN_idea_3_desc: "The Gonzaga family constructed a glorious palace on the outskirts of Mantua. Filled with fountains and beautiful Renaissance frescoes, it inspires wonder in any neighboring dignitary who visits it."
 MAN_idea_4_desc: "In ancient times the Langobards invaded Byzantine Italy and established a powerful kingdom which would last for centuries and eventually be incorporated into the Frankish Empire. The blood of these great warriors runs through our veins."
 #Aquileia
 friulan_idea_2: "Langobard Heritage"
 friulan_idea_2_desc: "In the early Middle Ages, our lands were the shield of the Langobard kingdom against the savage barbarians coming from the east; the fighting spirit of our forefathers still lives within us, and once again we shall defend our lands from any foreign threat."
 #Sette Comuni
 STC_idea_3_desc: "'The Seven Commons defend themselves': this is the motto of our Militia. Although its size can not even come close to that of the great armies of other European states, it is well equipped and determined to defend our lands at all costs."
 STC_idea_6_desc: "Our daily life is governed by many ancient sets of laws; if we were to reform them to create a unified Constitution, our realm would gain international recognition as a proper nation."
 #Latin Empire
 LEM_idea_1_desc: "In 1204 the heroism of Enrico Dandolo led us to finally capture the City of the World's Desire from heretics. Our state was built on blood, and by blood it stays together."
 #Konigsegg
 KGG_idea_5_desc: "In 1622, Königsegg split into Königsegg-Aulendorf and Königsegg-Rothenfels. As a result of this, regions under the house of Königsegg became more able to think independently, since the rulers were separate."
 KGG_idea_6_desc: "Situated in one of the most thoroughly depopulated regions of the HRE during the thirty years war, the locals learned how to keep surviving, in spite of there being very few people around."
 #Frankfurt
 Frankfurt_Messe: "The Frankfurt Messe"
 Frankfurt_Messe_desc: "The Frankfurt Messe Marketplace sends many traders to our city and brings many goods with them, with continued effort the Frankfurt Messe will remain the greatest market in the Rhine."
 Frankfurt_Stock_desc: "The Frankfurt stock exchange and its predecessor currency markets that were based out of our city for many generations has left us, with the skills needed to manage inflation."
 Frankfurt_Churches: "The Many Churches of Frankfurt"
 Frankfurt_Nationalism_desc: "We are the birthplace of German nationalism and as such we are prone to expand quickly and have good reasons behind it."
 FRN_ideas_start: "Frankfurter Traditions"
 #Zurich
 Establishment_of_the_zuercher_city_council_desc: "In 1218 the Reichsvogtei passed back into the hands of the king, who appointed one of the burghers as his deputy, the town thus becoming a free imperial city under the nominal rule of a distant sovereign. This council (all-powerful since 1304) was made up of the representatives of certain knightly and rich mercantile families, who excluded the craftsmen from all share in the government, though it was to the latter that the town was largely indebted for its rising wealth and importance."
 Supraregional_trade_center: "Supraregional Trade Center"
 The_reformation_by_zwingli_desc: "Zwingli was together with Calvin the most important figure of the Swiss reformation. From the Grossmünster he preached ideas of reforming the Catholic Church. Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. The Reformation spread but some cantons remained Catholic which lead to the religious wars of Kappel."
 Zuercher_Ramparts_desc: "From 1642, an impressive set of ramparts was built based on plans by Hans Georg Werdmüller and Johann Ardüser, at an immense cost and completed only in the second half of the 18th century. The ramparts included fifteen bastions, one of them built inside the Limmat."
 #Waldstatt
 Ruetlischwur_desc: "In 1291 three envoys from Uri, Schwyz und Unterwalden swore an oath, on Rütli above Lake Lucerne, to combine forces and fight against the Habsburgs. The Swiss Confederation was born."
 Battle_of_morgarten_desc: "In 1315 a 1,500-strong force from Swiss Confederacy ambushed a 7,000-man strong army of Austrian soldiers of the Holy Roman Empire on the shores of Lake Ägeri near the Morgarten Pass in Switzerland. The Swiss troops were poorly equipped but thanks to their bravery and tactics they managed to heavily defeat the Habsburg army."
 Teufelsbruecken_desc: "To be able to cross the Alps and have a connection with North Italy the three Cantons built bridges, which connected North and South Europe. Some say these bridges were built by Satan himself."
 Gotthardpass_desc: "The three Cantons had gained a lot of attention with the opening of the Gotthardroute. It became the most important route during the Middle Ages because trade could now easily travel through the Swiss Alps from North Italy to South Germany."
 New_friends: "New Friends"
 New_friends_desc: "For a long time the three cantons stayed alone but after some decades new cantons joined the confederation: Luzern (1332), Zurich (1351), Glarus und Zug (1352), and Bern (1353)."
 The_Fatherland_of_uri_desc: "During the Helvetic Republic Uri was together with Schwyz and Unterwalden forced into one canton. This hadn't gained much popularity and so during the whole time of the Republic the conservative elites tried to right the new order."
 #Bern
 The_bear_of_bern_desc: "Local legend says that the founder of Bern Berchtold V, Duke of Zähringen named the city after the first animal which he met on the hunt as this turned out to be a bear. In the late medieval period, Bern was very strongly identified with its heraldic animal, which was used as an allegory of the military and feudal power of the canton within the Old Swiss Confederacy. The Bernese citizen-soldiers were depicted as armed bears."
 By_fire_and_sword: "By Fire and Sword"
 Bernese_glass_paintings: "Bernese Glass Paintings"
 Baeuerten_and_Talverbaenden: "Bäuerten and Talverbänden"
 The_alliance_with_the_Confederacy: "The Alliance with the Confederacy"
 The_alliance_with_the_Confederacy_desc: "In 1323 Bern entered an alliance with the Forest Cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. Two years later Bern upgraded its pact with the forest cantons to an eternal alliance, thus becoming a permanent member of the Old Swiss Confederacy. With Bern's accession, the confederacy had now reached a count of eight Cantons, concluding its formative period and entering its period of successful consolidation."
 The_bernese_pikes_desc: "In 1339 Habsburg-leaning Fribourg went into a war against Bern. When the Fribourg forces laid siege to the Bernese border town of Laupen, the Bernese army marched out to raise the siege. While outnumbered two to one, the Bernese forces formed strong pike blocks that destroyed the Fribourg infantry and heavy cavalry. The decisive Bernese victory allowed Bern to consolidate their power and brought them closer to the Forest Cantons."
 #Basel
 Basler_earthquake: "Basler Earthquake"
 Basler_earthquake_desc: "The earthquake in 1356 is the most significant seismological event to have occurred in Central Europe in recorded history. The death toll ranges between 100-2000 people. Despite this it took only 14 years to completely rebuild the town."
 Council_of_Basel_desc: "It took place from 1431 to 1449, although because of an argument it was split and was continued in Ferrara and Firenze. A part of the discussion was to abolish celibacy and reform the calendar. But the most important issue was the reunification with the Orthodox Church. When the members couldn't agree on the issues the Pope moved it to another location."
 University_of_basel_desc: "The Basler University was founded in 1460 and is the oldest University in Switzerland. During its existence it gave Switzerland and Europe many scientists which made their mark on the Continent."
 The_cultural_capital_of_switzerland_desc: "Thanks to the spread of printing, cultural life could boom in Basel. It was a residence to many humanists like Erasmus von Rotterdam or Paracelsus."
 Zuenfte_of_basel_desc: "Like in many other German towns, the burghers were an economic powerhouse but didn't have any political rights. This changed in Basel in 1521."
 The_abolishment_of_the_bishop_desc: "After the reformation many Catholic priests had to leave the city. The same happened to the bishop. All the belongings of the church were taken by the town."
 Urban_rural_conflict_desc: "The town of Basel dominated the whole time over the rural areas which lead to uprisings. Most of them were brutally pacified which gave stability and order in these lands again."
 #Ulm
 ULM_trade_desc: "The privilege of Köningspfalz granted to us ensured that we would always have some sort of importance in Swabian trade; we just need to make use of this."
 ULM_constitution_desc: "Sometimes referred to as our constitution, the Großer Schwörbrief outlines both our mercantile society and our republicanism."
 ULM_church_desc: "The Ulm Minster is our tribute to the Catholic Church, although unlike the other churches of Germany, ours was paid for by the people and the state, meaning we have extensive control over its use as Ulmer property."
 ULM_textiles_desc: "The great industry of Ulm is its textiles; our cloth is renowned in Europe for its great quality, and as such our businesses have flourished."
 ULM_Conquistador_desc: "Although not very possible to colonize, our nation has sent our best - Nikolaus Federmann - to Spain, so that he may help their ventures in Colombia, and perhaps... help us?"
 ULM_rennisance_desc: "Although later than preferred, the flourishing economy from both colonialism and textiles has given the state funds to hire such great minds as Hans Multscher and Jörg Syrlin the Elder."
 #Anjou
 ANJ_idea_2: "Realm of Diversity"
 ANJ_idea_2_desc: "Our home dynasty once united such varied cultures from across Europe that the wisest men could not speak even half of the languages spoken in the Angevin kingdom and duchies. Each of the Angevins had to adapt. We need for our rulers to not be distant monarchs, far away from the common people's problems, but to be caring and protective for every culture that inhabits their realm."
 ANJ_idea_3: "Legacy of Dynastic Conflicts"
 ANJ_idea_3_desc: "It is not easy to persuade people into fighting for succession, since most of the common folk do not care about from where their suzerain comes, until he decides to close up with them – but this can be made only after winning said war! When we are in need of regular armies, we have an advantage though: Italian condottieri, Hungarian riders, French raubritters, and even Gallowglasses from the British Isles are at our disposal... Not cheaply though. However, we have some experience in gaining lower prices, since dynastic conflicts of our dynasty tormented Europe for nearly 200 years."
 ANJ_idea_4_desc: "Once upon a time the king of Bohemia Vaclav III fought with Charles Robert d'Anjou for the Crown of St. Stephen. Then, he was murdered. Although some evidence we maintain proves that the assassin was a little chubby girl trained from childhood to be a professional killer, we must admit that she created a great advantage for us and she deserved a cookie. We shall call the art of monarch elimination 'Advanced Dynastic Management' and teach it to our spies abroad, to help us in incoming dynastic struggles. Even if we don't murder anybody along the way, spying efficiency will rise."
 ANJ_idea_6_desc: "Among abundant fields of artichoke and asparagus, vineyards, and berry bushes stand, like white mountains shading the Loire valley, simultaneously mighty and delicate chateaux. In those palace-fortresses dwells the elite of our glorious country. They can be proud of their homes, since their castles shine with the splendour of the Renaissance on all Europe."
 ANJ_idea_7_desc: "Those chateaux we may boast about are beautiful for a reason: they are built using tuffeau: light, radiant stone that continues to impress foreigners when they see villages of it, bathed in sunlight. Expanded stone-mining industry makes it easier for us to lower construction costs, although I believe it is the pleasure of working with such wonderful material which makes buildings cheaper."
 #Hiberno-Norman
 HiberNor_idea_2_desc: "It rarely happens that new settlers don't accept parts of the neighboring culture as their own, and they often even adopt their way of life and language, especially if your neighbors have some hearty jigs. It may be possible we are not real strangers anymore, but the same folk as the Irish; and while some say we became 'more Irish than the Irish themselves' we are proud of our mixed heritage."
 HiberNor_idea_5_desc: "The English have allegedly brought the Irish a more 'civilized' form of government by establishing feudalism. Former counties were split into so-called cantreds. Although our assimilated culture has turned this feudalism into a more clan-like form, we have a great advantage in terms of connection with numerous subjects and eventual lieges."
 HiberNor_idea_6_desc: "Attempts of turning our culture back to 'proper' English haven't succeeded, as the Crown didn't have enough power to enforce them. Right now, however, the Crown has no power at all and we are vulnerable to enemy invasions. The only useful thing we could bring out from these Statutes is advice to train more of our settlers in traditional English fighting sports like archery or lancing, so that more citizens of our realm will have the opportunity to effectively stand in defence of our homeland."
 HiberNor_idea_7_desc: "As with most states that relied heavily on settlers, we have much experience in arranging for more potential folks coming to the wild land just around the corner. After all, our hearts may be Irish, but our minds and bodies still serve the English purpose!"
 #Crusader States
 CrusaderS_idea_1_desc: "We have come here to save the holiest of places from heretic hands, inspired by the Pope and his wise words. If someone obeyed His Holiness to such a degree, how can he and his heirs not be the most important dukes in the Christian world?"
 CrusaderS_idea_2_desc: "Great names like Godefroid de Bouillon or Guy de Lusignan are, unfortunately, relics of the past: times are changing, and we don't need either feudal scrambles or brave knights in shining armor, which are so easy to shoot through! We will do away with the old order, but never overlook the need for a large number of sons: all their bad traits and flaws seemingly lose any meaning, and there will be no problem with having many children: local maids are swarthy and voluptuous..."
 CrusaderS_idea_3: "Outremer Trade"
 CrusaderS_idea_3_desc: "Silk! Spices! Fruits, pistachios, nuts, almonds, dates! Vanillas, mmh, yes, sweet vanillas! WINE! MORE WINE! By God Almighty, everything so fresh, so tasty, so shiny and beautiful! Trade with Venice and Genoa is profitable enough that if I were to give one florin to a beggar for each ten thousand florins some merchant gains, he would be rich by midnight! Let us profit from this, for there is no other way to India that through the East! Those foolish Portuguese, how can they think they can sail south and find passage there? Nay, nay, there are monsters there! Dumb Iberians..."
 CrusaderS_idea_6_desc: "He who has piety in his heart, sword in his hand, blue blood in his veins, dust in his chest and a tiny swathe of land should join a militant order and sacrifice his life for the greater good, fighting heathen and heretic. He would best do this job, however, by simply becoming an officer, inspiring and introducing his men to strict monastic discipline. If we manage to get a whole cadre of these officers, our armies would become unstoppable."
 CrusaderS_idea_7: "Brothers in Faith"
 #Toulouse
 TOU_idea_3_desc: "Our county is indisputably the birthplace of high and sophisticated Occitan culture. We would clearly be the foremost in arts and science – if not for corrupt crusaders and the vile kings of France. It hasn't been long since those times - now that we are free, we should regain our affluence!"
 TOU_idea_4_desc: "Consistory of the Gay Science isn't about finding new ways for spoiled young nobles to sodomize themselves – its something created to preserve fine chants and songs of troubadours for future Occitan generations. We should promote poetry for contenting young nobles in more moral way, preserving the lenga d'Oc and keeping our country stable."
 TOU_idea_5_desc: "The city of Toulouse began to free itself from feudal laws early, and in 1152 'Capitouls' was founded, an assembly of city administrators that rivaled the count and fought for burghers' rights. Giving our cities privileges might be useful, when it bears us larger control over trade..."
 TOU_idea_6_desc: "Seeing the incoming wave of Enlightenment sprawling across Europe, we might expect that from villages hidden deep in Languedoc hills Cathar preachers will come: the Perfecti, living ascetic lifestyles and teaching people about who really created the world and who is really worshipped by Catholic priests. We should take advantage and either use them as priests of New Christianity or learn their methods and hunt down the Good Men once and for all."
 # #Champagne
 CHP_idea_1_desc: "All courtiers in the French royal court had to obey a seneschal: he also administered royal domains and replaced the King in many matters when he was absent. Such great power in the Kingdom of France was hereditary to counts of Champagne: now one of the contestants for the throne in Paris. Our past gives us great knowledge in civil matters and administration."
 CHP_idea_2: "Champagnian Independence"
 CHP_idea_4_desc: "It is on our ground where Hunnic hordes were stopped and crushed by Aetius, the Last Roman. We are proud to host such sacred ground, and we are bound to learn from Romans about their tactics and strategy, which saved Europe from utter destruction."
 CHP_idea_5_desc: "In the cathedral in our capital the Kings of France had to be crowned, and that gives us a great advantage in uniting the shattered country – we already have the required place of coronation. While our architects and engineers work on strengthening its defence, we should learn how to strengthen the ties between duchies that will bow to us when we unite France."
 CHP_idea_6_desc: "One of the counts of Champagne and King of Navarre as well, Thibaut de Blois, was a famous crusader and poet. The Renaissance wave that arrived in our lands from Italy might cause a revolution in our arts and poetry, but his call to holy war will never be drowned out:\n'Qui n'a en soi pitié ni souvenance,\nAu haut Seigneur doit chercher sa vengeance,\nEt délivrer sa terre et son pays.'"
 #Cologne
 KOL_idea_3_desc: "Why in Bonn, and not in Cologne? Well, the truth is that constant conflicts between the Archbishop and burghers resulted in the secession of our nominal capital as the Free City of Cologne. We should rethink our opinions on trade and divine supremacy, and turn the other cheek: if we can establish an agreement, we can get access to lucrative Rhine commerce in the richest of inland Hanseatic cities!"
 KOL_idea_4_desc: "To be in Cologne and not to see the magnificent cathedral, is to be blind... as from every street, square, and building it can be seen dominating the city skyline. Housing innumerable treasures and relics, including precious remnants of the Three Wise Men, it guarantees we will always stay true to the Catholic faith."
 KOL_idea_5_desc: "Regular troops of the City of Cologne were called The Red Sparks for their astonishing red uniforms. Having a regular army in a war-torn Empire is nearly a must, so we must cooperate with the City to enhance our military performance."
 KOL_idea_6: "Wittelsbach Archbishops"
 #Avignon
 AVI_idea_2_desc: "We are prodigies in the modern-day economy: the new invention of foreign exchange markets was first established here in 1248. The Holy See used it to maintain numerable financial relations with European monarchs, but now we are free. If we restrict its use to our economic adversaries, we will quickly see their economy falter."
 AVI_idea_5_desc: "Let's face it: Avignon popes were not really rightful popes. Not truly independent, they marked the beginning of a schism tormenting the one true Catholic Church. The Palace of Popes (and Antipopes) is a reminder of how they used to claim things that were not quite theirs. Who said it is not useful in politics?"
 AVI_idea_6_desc: "Legend has it the bridge in Avignon was built by Saint Benezet. When Jesus himself told him to create a passage across the Rhone, he formed The Bridge Brotherhood to help him in construction. Recreation of this Brotherhood will enhance communication a lot."
 AVI_idea_7_desc: "We must remember the times when we were the seat of the spiritual ruler of half of Europe: the Pope of Avignon was supported by the kings of France, Scotland, Aragon and Castile. The time of glory will come once more, however, not by the power of the Church, but by the power of our armies and subjects."
 #Electoral
 Electoral_idea_1_desc: "We, the Electors of the Reich, hereby declare that it is only in our right to choose the Emperor, and neither the Pope nor foreign kings shall influence our decisions. We shall thus form an alliance within ourselves, to ensure that we will not be forced to accept any dominion. Let Virgin Mary bless our men of state and Archbishops so that they will be always understood in good trust, even if their sinful minds have no good intentions."
 Electoral_idea_2_desc: "The Rhein is a vein for imperial trade, and our location combined with prerogatives of electoral dignities give us trade possibilities second only to the Dutch. But trading might not be the best way to gain money as Prince-Archbishops. Instead, we can get indulgences. Pecunia non olet."
 Electoral_idea_3_desc: "We also decree that absolutely no subject of the Trier diocese can be summoned at the instance of any plaintiff beyond these same territories to any foreign tribunal. Check your privilege, Electors! Subjects of ours Serene Highnesses cannot appeal to any higher court, thus making us truly lords on our lands. It is right and just for us to deliver Solomonic judgments, as we are the deputy of Christ on Earth... but the Emperor might revoke this privilege. Nah, there are several reforms before that, they won't make it."
 Electoral_idea_5_desc: "For such privileges and charters, if, and in as far as, they are considered to derogate in any way from the liberties, jurisdictions, rights, honors or dominions of the said Prince Electors, or any one of them, in so far we revoke them of certain knowledge and cancel them, and decree, from the plenitude of our Imperial power, that they shall be considered and held to be revoked.\nWe could be true masters in our own castles – if not for article 13 of the Golden Bull, a perilous paragraph that gives the current Emperor the ability to revoke our rights whenever he wishes. Let him come, we say. We shall be prepared."
 #Stavelot-Malmedy
 hre_univ_ssm_mosan_art_desc: "Mosan art is a regional style of art from the valley of the Meuse. It generally refers to Romanesque art, with Mosan Romanesque architecture, stone carving, metalwork, enameling and manuscript illumination reaching a high level of development during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries."
 hre_univ_ssm_votum_virile_desc: "As a prince-abbot, the abbot of Stavelot-Malmedy sat in the College of Ruling Princes of the Ecclesiastical Bench of the Imperial Diet. Along with the handful of other prince-abbots, he cast a full vote (votum virile), in contrast to the majority of imperial abbots who were only entitled to a collective vote on their respective curial benches."

 hre_univ_fdx_fulda_gap_desc: "The Fulda Gap is a strategically important area between the Hesse-Thuringian border and Frankfurt. Because of that, there is always an army present."

 #Ziegenhain
 ZGN_idea_1_desc: "After the marriage of Count Gormar III's daughter Luckardis with Friedrich of Thuringia, her husband made claims to the County of Ziegenhain, and difficulties arose. The dispute was terminated with a contract. But we will never again fall into the same trap!"

 FXI_idea_1_desc: "The Wittelsbachs have always tried to influence and take over Freising. But Freising remained independent and didn't concede."
 FXI_idea_2_desc: "The Diocese of Freising was much larger than the Prince-Bishopric. This also means that the Prince-Bishop had much more power than one would think."
 FXI_idea_3_desc: "Freising had an army with professional soldiers, but they couldn't be considered noble or aristocratic. Many men fighting for the Prince-Bishop had an unfree background. These soldiers were considered by Bavarian Law as semi-dependents from the Bishop."
 FXI_idea_7_desc: "This is a chronicle ordered by Johann Franz Ecker van Kapfing und Lietezech during the Golden Age of Freising. It was commissioned by the Benedictine monk Karl Meichelbeck. It is considered as one of the first examples of critical historical research in Germany."
 #Sayn
 XSY_idea_1: "Unclear Succession"
 XSY_idea_1_desc: "The Sayner succession was never clear, meaning all the land could belong to the wrong family branch that the enemy is targeting. Furthermore, if others do occupy our land, how many family members will gather resistances? They won't know!"

 NNN_idea_4_desc: "Suhl was an economic center of the county with its extensive mining and arms manufacturing. Even after the counts of Henneberg Suhl remained important, and became specialized in rifles and guns. During the heyday of copper and iron around 1600, the weapons forge became one of the most important in all of Europe. This fact made this core region one of the most threatened in the imminent war of confessions."
 NNN_idea_6_desc: "Around 1545, the last Henneberger Count died childless and without any heir. With the Kahlaer Vertrag, Henneberg was inherited by Saxony."
 NNN_idea_7_desc: "Graf von Henneberg Porzellan was a manufacturer of household porcelain, founded in 1777 in Ilmenau, Thuringia. The name was borrowed from the counts of Henneberg, to whose county Ilmenau had belonged in the Middle Ages. At the time of the founding the House of Henneberg had already been extinguished for 150 years."
 #Salm
 SLM_idea_2_desc: "The economy of Salm was mainly focused on its iron mine in Grandfontaine. The forgeries of Framont were an important economical and militaristic factor for the principality, and they were expanded frequently. There was also a refinery for copper."
 SLM_idea_4_desc: "Hermann I was the most important member the Salm family ever had. He was elected anti-king, and lead his troops in some victorious battles. Herman II, his son, was also a militarist and expanded his territory through conquest."
 SLM_idea_6_desc: "The Salm family held many lordships and states under its banner. Its dynastic territory was widespread, with not only holdings like Anholt, but also in the Wildgrafschaften and Rheingrafschaften.

But even though the family did divide these lands, they still shared sovereignty."
 SLM_idea_7: "Salm Revived!"

 #Bouillon
 BLL_idea_1_desc: "Godfrey of Bouillon was one of the leaders of the First Crusade. He captured Nicaea and Antioch. After the capture of Jerusalem, the crown of Jerusalem was offered to him, but he refused because he did not want to wear a golden crown where Jesus had one of thorns. He instead became the Defender of the Holy Sepulchre."
 BLL_idea_3: "Fortoresse du Semois"
 BLL_idea_3_desc: "The Castle of Bouillon is situated on a rocky spur of land within a sharp bend of the Semois River. The fort had the reputation of being impregnable."
 #Dutch Ducal
 dutch_ducal_idea_1_desc: "The Rhine is a very important river for trade. And the Dutch could control much of it because they are in a key region with nearby access to the sea."
 dutch_ducal_idea_3_desc: "During the Reformation, reformed thinkers preached in places outside the city, where there was little control. This enhanced the spread of the new faith without starting direct conflicts."
 dutch_ducal_idea_6_desc: "This is the first official Bible translated in the Dutch language. Because before this translation there was no real standard for the Dutch language, so they had to make one; an important step in standardizing the language. Due to the Eighty Years' War, many Flemish intellectuals fled to the Netherlands, and thus they also influenced the language used."
 dutch_ducal_idea_7_desc: "Even from the 16th century the Netherlands had a real flower culture. When later the tulips arrived, they became so popular that the price of these costly flowers became much higher. This was known as the tulip mania. In the 18th century, the tulips became more reasonably priced, so that more common people could buy them. Since then, these flowers became an import export good."
 #Eichstatt
 ECH_idea_2_desc: "We have always been a step ahead of the Bavarians. We also settled the region first."
 ECH_idea_4_desc: "We still have some secluded territories, and these territorial secular states aren't letting us freely pass through. Even worse, could they be eyeing these territories? We are really wrestling now with this idea: Should we make more troops, or shall we wait and see?"
 ECH_idea_5_desc: "We once received much more land from the mighty family of the counts of Hirschberg. That also means we can now build a larger army. If we manage to get even more inheritances, we will get even more land!"
 #Kempten
 kempten_idea_1_desc: "The Abbot of Kempten was ruthless in driving his population into serfdom, even more than the abbot of Salem. This was due to the primary basis of territorial rule being based on lordship over serfs."
 kempten_idea_2_desc: "The emperor of Germany granted privileges to the abbots, granting them a seat in the Reichstag, but also made the city of Kempten an Imperial City, marking the start of the co-existence of the two bearing the same name. Later, the last properties and rights of the abbots were sold in the so-called Great Purchase. This reduced tensions between the two."
 kempten_idea_3_desc: "Kempten served as base for the Allgäu army, most importantly during the Peasants' War and the Reformation. Kempten was also one of the, if not the, major powers in the Allgäu region."
 kempten_idea_4: "Practice Guardianship"
 kempten_idea_4_desc: "Clerics were forbidden to shed blood, and thus were not allowed to wage wars. But in a period of noble feuding, this rule placed ecclesiastical rulers in a difficult position. Some church leaders, especially bishops and prince-abbots, ignored the sanctions and even came to practice guardianship over their weaker neighbors. Kempten was a notable example of this, since weaker neighbors were plentiful."
 kempten_idea_6: "Lead the Reichsadler"
 kempten_idea_6_desc: "The City of Kempten received the right to lead the Reichsadler with the imperial crown in its town coat-of-arms. Squadrons of Kempten were easily recognizable, and were once spotted during the liberation of the captured King in Bruges."
 kempten_idea_7: "Diverse Economy"
 kempten_idea_7_desc: "From the second half of the 17th century, the Abbot sought to strengthen the agricultural economy. This was done by a state-owned economy. But the abbot could never achieve the variety of guilds and craftsmen like the Imperial City of Kempten had."
 #Salem
 XSE_idea_1: "Very High Imperial Tax"
 XSE_idea_1_desc: "From 1550 onwards, the Abbey paid much more to the Emperor for its size compared to all other abbeys. The other highest ranked abbeys, Kempten and Constance, paid much less. This was due to a combination of very high income and lack of political influence. Salem was probably the wealthiest abbey."
 XSE_idea_2: "Freehold Vineyards"
 XSE_idea_2_desc: "Salem's territory was located in a fertile winegrowing region, and many freehold parcels were vineyards. Freehold vineyards were the major source of wealth for many households, including some of the wealthiest."
 XSE_idea_3_desc: "Salem's trade network was far more extensive than its location might suggest, thanks to its possessions of numerous Stadthofe and other urban properties."
 XSE_idea_4_desc: "This was a court of law, who sat at regular intervals, usually once per month. The Sidelgericht also raised political consciousness among ordinary people, embodied the territorial community, publicized territorial price limits and had some legislative power."

 flemish_ducal_idea_3_desc: "These were amateur poets who formed chambers from the Late Medieval Era. They had a big influence on the language, mainly in the Flemish region where earlier they were more active."
 flemish_ducal_idea_4_desc: "The word contains the words bell and fortress. Belforts were watchtowers permitted to build in its defence. They showed the richness of the city, and like in Ghent, were also used to stock the treasury and the city rights."
 flemish_ducal_idea_5_desc: "Due to commerce, the number and richness of the Burghers increased drastically. They were sometimes even richer than the nobility. The Burghers protested, and received a lot of power in the cities. These cities will later rebel many times, and have even caused wars."
 flemish_ducal_idea_6_desc: "During many centuries, the Flemish people have quenched their thirst with beer, because water was usually contaminated, and beer seemed safe. They did however not know that the boiling of beer during the process caused this. Starting from the Medieval times, abbeys have brewed beer to gain money."
 flemish_ducal_idea_7_desc: "Van den vos Reynaerde is the Middle Dutch version of the story of Reynard, as written by Willem die Madoc maecte. It is considered a major work of Middle Dutch literature and has been called the pinnacle of Gothic literature in the Netherlands. Later, it was used by Flemish separatists as a symbol for the fight against the powerful."
 #Pfullendorf
 PFU2_idea_2_desc: "Pfullendorf in the 8th-10th centuries used to have a grand treasury; the recent recessions were covered up by our rulers by blaming surrounding trade cities for stealing all the trade and wealth out of our pocket, making our people believe that we really need to go and take, ahem, get back what belongs to us."
 PFU2_idea_3_desc: "Envoys, who are paid well by our state, have been taking too many questionable stops at bath houses and other locations on the way, so we started to accompany them with a guard, which is paid more the faster the envoy gets to the location. Results are visible from day 1."
 PFU2_idea_5_desc: "Ever since Count Ludwig was assassinated we have distanced ourselves from politics for the security of our own rulers; we shall not repeat our mistakes."
 PFU2_idea_6_desc: "Whenever some nearby state decides to start drama about us, we have our own printers ready; we pay them a coin or two for manipulating the news in favour of our side."
 PFU2_idea_7_desc: "Rebels are being persecuted in surrounding lands, but Pfullendorf, with the complex laws that it has, cannot persecute them. Rebel group leaders know this and have used Pfullendorf as their base of operations, and it just so happens that Pfullendorf itself might have some interests in cutting the power of some states."
 #Frei Pfullendorf
 PFU_idea_1: "Pfullendorfer Construction Quality"
 PFU_idea_1_desc: "Pfullendorf builders are some of the best in Europe; their houses stand for over 700 years until they get destroyed by war, a sad truth of Europa."
 PFU_idea_2: "Aggression of Konstanz Bishops"
 PFU_idea_6: "A Good Example for Others"
 PFU_idea_6_desc: "Starting in 1383, Pfullendorf ruled itself according to a constitution that gave decisive powers to the town guilds and provided for the annual election of the mayor. A 50-member 'High Council' also elected annually, was vested with executive authority alongside a 17-member 'Small Council' chaired by the mayor. With brief interruptions, this guild-based constitution remained in force until 1803 and was to serve as a model for other cities."
 PFU_idea_7: "Renowned in History Books"

 JCH_idea_3_desc: "Julich's realm prospers from its proximity to the River Rur, providing a nice boost in income."

 STT_idea_7_desc: "Versus the vile threat that is the Savoyard, our prince-bishopric must make some expansion to further weaken the horrid fiends. We are sure that our neighbours wouldn't mind when our survival is endangered."
 #Valais
 VLL_idea_1_desc: "In 999, King Rodolphe III entrusted the rights to the bishop of Sion and his successors. This document, the charter of donation of 999, established at Cudrefin, on the shore of Lake Neuchâtel, is the authentic founding act of the Valais as a state. This is the first time, with a donation similar to the Bishop of Basel in the same year, where in the territory of Switzerland royal rights are transmitted to the local lords."
 VLL_idea_2_desc: "A great castle was built recently in Chastellon, its grandeur is monumental and our foes shudder when they think about it. It will probably still stand in a thousand years!"

 NSA_idea_4_desc: "This is the nickname of Herborn, a city located in the County of Nassau. It received this nickname because during the Thirty Years' War, the townsfolk looked after Swedish soldiers, which brought them protection by the Swedish army. Thus it also gained a reputation as field hospital town or Lazarettstadt."
 NSA_idea_5: "Usinger Government Center"
 NSA_idea_5_desc: "In the first third of the 18th century, a uniform administration developed in Nassau-Usingen. The Hofstaat, with the Hofmeister at the head, formed the only central administrative authority. Usingen was expanded as the sole government center, and the influence of the offices, who had prior to this great room for maneuver, sank."
 NSA_idea_6_desc: "Usually, all the college's member states were required to provide a contingent of troops in case of war.

 SMB_idea_2_desc: "The illustrious founder of our state, Adolf of Holstein, played an important role in the colonization of the wild pagan lands to the north of the Elbe river. Since the great Slavic revolt centuries ago, the river had acted as a bold natural barrier to any expansion efforts. Adolf helped change this."

 #Thorn
 THO_idea_2: "No Religious Vows"
 THO_idea_2_desc: "In the 15th century the Pope finally granted the abbey's wish to no longer have to wear the usual black overcoat.

 THO_idea_7_desc: "Many armies had quartered in the very small territory of Thorn because of its strategic location near the Lowlands. But these troops caused huge military expenses, forcing Thorn to take loans and to try to change the Imperial Circle they belonged to. They asked their Circle if they could no longer pay them, since many similarly small territories didn't have to pay and they had the cost of the quartering troops (this cost was mentioned as being due to Criegs Troubelen). If the Circle would not agree, Thorn would ask compensation for the quartering of troops."
 #Berchtesgaden

 CMB_idea_6_desc: "The ruling Bishop in Cambrai took little account of the townies and traders. Because of this they conspired and took over the city. Eventually they received their own council and they received the management of the finances. This council, the Conjurationes, was lead by a patriciate, and would later also be responsible for military and diplomatic decisions."

 USR_idea_5: "Necessity of Spies"
 USR_idea_5_desc: "Because of Macva being such a point of contention between several great powers, we have learned how to play them off each other successfully. However, this can also be achieved through public, accepted methods..."

 VOL_idea_2_desc: "The Duchy of Halych and Volhynia has developed a robust administration. Previously, the duke assembled the Duma once a year to solve the problems of the realm. Since the 14th century it had become continuous and even had the power to veto the duke's laws. The country was divided into Volosts which were governed by boyars that had a seat in the Duma. There were also such jobs as Dvorskii (Butler), Pechatnik (modern-day Foreign Minister), Writer, Stolnik and many others."
 VOL_idea_5: "Halych Army"
 VOL_idea_5_desc: "The army of Halych consists of two parts. The first one consists of Boyars, their sons, and civil servants. They are the cavalry part of our army.

 #Como
 CMO_idea_1_desc: "When the Langobards descended into Italy they conquered most of Byzantium's holdings in Northern Italy. Only Como's territory managed to hold out alone for over 20 years, thanks to Greek general Francione and his last stand on Isola Comacina."
 CMO_idea_2_desc: "Three-Chapter Controversy was a theological controversy that took place in the sixth century, in which our church came closer to the Patriarchate of Aquileia and cut its ties to the Milanese church. Because of this we have a greater control over our church without the external influence of Milan."
 CMO_idea_3_desc: "The Magistri Cumacini were a corporation of stonemasons that dated back to Lombard times. They came from the many valleys in our territory and were architects, stone workers and even siege engineers. Their works can be traced in many places in Europe."
 CMO_idea_4_desc: "Milan and Como had a war that lasted 10 years between 1117 and 1127 to increase their trade and influence, ending with a Milanese victory, who destroyed Como. Como later had its vengeance against Milan in 1162 and against Isola Comacina in 1169. Our homes lay in ruins; we shall reconstruct our city and prepare our men to have our vengeance against Milan and all the villages that betrayed us."
 CMO_idea_5_desc: "The Castel Baradello was an old castle that overlooked Como and controlled the main entrance to the city at Ca'Merlata, between the Spina Verde and Monte Goi. When Frederick Barbarossa passed through Como not only did he stay at the Castello in 1159, but he also renewed it together with the city walls and its enormous walls."
 CMO_idea_6: "Between Lake and Valleys"
 CMO_idea_6_desc: "Lake Como, or Lario as it is called by the locals, is a fundamental part of the Comaschian economy and trade, and its control lets us have a better grip on the many villages lying along its shores. Also, our control of important valleys in the Alps like Valtellina, Val d'Intelvi, Valchiavenna and the lower part of Ticino gives us the opportunity to control the trade that goes through the Central Alps."
 CMO_idea_7_desc: "During the 12th and 13th centuries most of Italy was plagued by the wars between Guelphs and Ghibellines, and Como was no exception. The most important Ghibelline family in Como were the Rusca, or Rusconi, who owned large estates in Ticino, supported the Milanese family of Visconti and managed to create a Signoria twice in Como, while the Guelph family of Vitany opposed them. The many battles between the two factions have created battle-hardened men that we can recruit."
 #Lauffen
 LFF_idea_1: "Bridge Over the Neckar"
 LFF_idea_2_desc: "The knights during this period were mounted combatants. These type of warriors would remain almost the same during the next 500 years.

 LFF_idea_4_desc: "In the 15th century, Lauffen was characterized by conflicts over the complex fishing rights. A lake was created to have their own fishing grounds. But eventually Lauffen had to defend itself against Palatinate troops."
 LFF_idea_5_desc: "In the 9th century Lauffen was granted by the Emperor to the Margrave of Nordgau on condition that the inhospitable land should be suitably developed, as the Emperor intended to use it for hunting. The initial cultivation of wine and the first castle can be traced back to this period. It ended however, as the legend goes, because of the murdering of the Graf's infant daughter, Regiswindis. Her wet nurse killed her and threw the body in the Neckar. After this incident, the Margrave transferred the village back to the Emperor. The girl quickly became a saint because at her burial numerous miracles occurred. For a long time a cult was created around her, and Lauffen became a much-visited pilgrimage site due to her worship."
 LFF_idea_6_desc: "Due to its strategic location, the prosperous town suffered a lot from the Thirty Years' War. It changed many times from hands, was frequently plundered, its defences were demolished, crops and cattle were all seized, and almost nothing else was undamaged. After the war only about 150 people lived in Lauffen, although during the war the lowest had been 30. But it didn't end here: for the next two centuries, the town would suffer from many more wars with similar effects."

 XSZ_idea_4_desc: "In 1030 the city of Belz was reconquered by Yaroslav the Wise's druzhinniks. Yaroslav left a few groups of them to guard the Rus borders and train new warriors for his army."
 XSZ_idea_5_desc: "After the death of Yaroslav the Wise on February 20th, 1054, the states of the Rus start to break. Each small duchy wanted to claim surrounding lands. They didn't care about others anymore. That led to Polish, Lithuanian, German, Nomad and finally Tatar invasions in which no one decided to help their relatives in other realms. Under these circumstances Belz became encircled by enemies with different religions."
 XSZ_idea_6: "Different Overlords"
 XSZ_idea_6_desc: "Belz was captured by different states: Halych, Poland, Lithuania, Mazovia and others. But in each country it saved its uniqueness by finding a common language with all overlords and accepting their people in the land."
 XSZ_idea_7_desc: "During Polish rule, Belz became the seat of a Voivodeship. It had its own governor to deal with problems. In this time Belzian fortifications were rebuilt and restored."

 BLR_idea_7_desc: "In 1240 Grodno was burned by the Teutonic Knights. It was clear that Grodno could not protect itself. So in 1250, the local duke decided to become a vassal of the more powerful Lithuania to protect his lands."
 #Podolia
 ONU_idea_1_desc: "The land of Podolia was first a home for Sarmatian tribes. They were talented mounted warriors. They settled in this area in the early 3rd century BC and lived their nomadic life until Slavic people came here in the 4th century AD."

 ONU_idea_5_desc: "In 1672 the Ottoman Empire defeated Poland and Podolia was given to them. The Turks spread the Sunni faith across the region but very few people accepted it. Nevertheless this state has the largest concentration of East Slavic Sunni followers."
 ONU_idea_6: "Russian Governorate"
 ONU_idea_6_desc: "After the third Commonwealth partition most of Podolia became a part of the Russian Empire and became the Podolian Governorate. In 1815 the rest of Podolia was given to Russia by Austria."
 ONU_idea_7_desc: "The nature of Podolia is truly beautiful. In the 19th century many wonderful caves were discovered, Ozernaya and Khrustalnaya being the greatest of them."
 #Peremyshl
 PRY_idea_1_desc: "Peremyshl is situated in the Chernozem region. Chernozem provides rich soil, which allows people to harvest more than in most other regions of Rus."
 PRY_idea_2_desc: "In 1097 the council of Lyubech finally split Rus land between all Rurikovich members. Many people pretend to be the dukes of Peremyshl, but our duke defends his title."
 PRY_idea_3_desc: "Peremyshl is one of the few Rus states that has salt mines. Salt is an important trade good, which in earlier centuries was very profitable. In Rus until the 17th century, salt was the only spice available for peasants."
 PRY_idea_4_desc: "The duchy of Peremyshl had all availabilities to produce its own artillery. Iron mines were founded in the 14th century. The land is also rich with nitrate which is one of the necessities for gunpowder production."
 PRY_idea_5: "Sejmiks of the Voivodeship"
 PRY_idea_5_desc: "Sudova Vyshnia is a small town in the duchy of Peremyshl, where the Sejmiks of the voivodeship took place. These small sejms allowed non-Polish people in the voivodeship to solve problems of the state and sometimes make laws."
 PRY_idea_6_desc: "In the middle of the 19th century in Peremyshl a fortress was built. It served for a long time to protect the borders of Austria from potential conflicts with Russia."
 PRY_idea_7_desc: "After the Polish Partition Peremyshl became a significant city in Austrian Galicia. So soon afterwards, the garrison was replaced by Austrian soldiers and German mercenaries."
 #Zvenyhorod
 ZNY_idea_1_desc: "The Zvenyhorodian land was first settled by Buzhans and Dulebs. These tribes created many problems for the Rus. They were highly militaristic and aggressive. Even in the 11th century they still were a problem, but now not for the dukes of Zvenyhorod. Meanwhile, in 1086, the Buzhans successfully destroyed the army of Yaropolk of Turov and killed him."
 ZNY_idea_2_desc: "Zvenyhorod is the single place in the south-west Rus area where birch bark manuscripts were found. There are only three of them but this confirms that the people of this land were educated enough to write to each other."
 ZNY_idea_3_desc: "In 1124 the duchy of Zvenyhorod became the first to attempt to unite all south-west Russian lands. Duke Vladimir captured Peremyshl and set one of his sons to rule Zvenyhorod."
 ZNY_idea_4_desc: "The Dukes of Zvenyhorod had good relations with Hungarian rulers, so they invited Hungarians to develop their country and learn new crafts."
 ZNY_idea_5_desc: "The Zvenyhorod dukes also invited foreign leaders to command their armies. They had Polish, Hungarian and and other Rus leaders for better army maneuvers and tactics."
 ZNY_idea_6_desc: "Boyars ruled our country for more than 50 years after the last independent duke of Zvenyhorod was banished and escaped to Hungary. They improve relations with surrounding countries and finally decided that the state must become part of the duchy of Halych."
 ZNY_idea_7_desc: "Zvenyhorod always was a border post of all countries that it was in. It had borders with the Ottoman Empire, Hungary, Austria and Poland. That provided a need for full-time fort maintenance."
 #Sicilian-German
 SICG_idea_1_desc: "Guelphs and Ghibellines have been fighting for a few hundred years, and the Italian peninsula was the epicenter of the conflict, allowing us to develop larger armies that could recover more quickly from the fighting."
 SICG_idea_4_desc: "Our country is Swabian, and our lands are Sicilian and Neapolitan; we must make sure that Swabians are not only the ruling class but also the people."
 SICG_idea_5_desc: "Sicily is located in the middle of the Mediterranean, allowing us to gain more trade power and connect Constantinople, Venice, Genoa, Valencia and many other important ports to Sicily."
 SICG_idea_6_desc: "The Hohenstaufens have the ambition to own large empires, field massive armies and control the Holy Roman Empire, and they sure will try to achieve their ambitions with their superior diplomacy abilities."
 SICG_idea_7_desc: "Sicily has used offensive tactics to defeat their enemies, which over time developed into an advantage during sieges that was commonly exploited by the advanced Sicilian army."
 #Sicilian
 SIC_idea_5_desc: "Sicily is located in the middle of the Mediterranean, allowing us to gain more trade power and connect Constantinople, Venice, Genoa, Valencia and many other important ports to Sicily."
 #Lusatia
 LST_idea_5_desc: "In 1346 the Lusatian cities of Bautzen, Görlitz, Kamenz, Löbau, Zittau and Lauban formed the Lusatian League to protect against robber barons. It had their own legal system which established separate courts for the townspeople and farmers, and would influence the politics of Upper Lusatia for centuries to come."
 #Bolohoveni
 BOO_idea_1: "Vlachs Settlements"
 BOO_idea_1_desc: "Bolokhovtsi was settled by many ethnic groups, but the largest community are the Vlachs. They make more than 10% of our population. Accepting them to be part of our community can give us benefits in future."
 BOO_idea_2: "Increased Fortifications"
 BOO_idea_2_desc: "Just before the Tatar invasion at the end of the 12th century, many fortresses appeared in our land. It was the golden age of our country. Rus leaders tell of how there are 27 of them."
 BOO_idea_3_desc: "Slavic people made a huge impact on our history. By their influence our rulers start to call themselves dukes of Bolokhovtsi. They helped us in wars against nomads and other countries in the region to prove our status."
 BOO_idea_4_desc: "During the Tatar invasion our dukes joined forces to capture land. That gave our army incredible knowledge about cavalry usage in fights on different terrain."
 BOO_idea_5_desc: "After most of our people accepted the Orthodox faith, some settlements in the hills and on the edge of our borders were still followers of the traditional Slavic faith. That lasted even until the late 16th century."
 BOO_idea_6_desc: "The people of Bolokhovtsi needed to defend themselves against Halych. Fortunately Hungarian kings supplied us with modern weapons and leaders to teach our army to fight."
 BOO_idea_7_desc: "Wine is one of the most popular drinks. Our people grow enough for themselves and some of our traders even sell this highly valuable product to foreign countries."
 #Berladnici
 BDI_idea_1_desc: "Our country was a home for Halychian refugees. Some of them flee here to hide from the wrath of their dukes, others come to serve or to find a new home."
 BDI_idea_2_desc: "The Danube is of the greatest rivers in Europe. Near the Black Sea its confluence has a mild climate, which fortunately can be used by our peasants to harvest better yields each year than our neighbours."
 BDI_idea_3_desc: "In the middle of the 12th century the duke of Berladnici was at war with duchy of Halych. To fight this war they needed a lot of money, so Ivan Berladnic visited Byzantium to find support. Unfortunately Berladnici lost this war and Ivan fled to Greece to find cover in a friendly country."
 BDI_idea_4_desc: "In the 13th century Berladnici was an Orthodox country, so the Pope and the Hungarian king decided to spread the Catholic faith together in this region. Only a small amount of people accepted Catholicism, but it is enough to recognize their rights."
 BDI_idea_5_desc: "Nomadic people were always on the borders of our country, with such tribes as the Pechenegs, Cumans and Kipchaks. We need to protect our border more often than Rus states so constant reinforcement is very important for our sovereignty."
 BDI_idea_6_desc: "The 'Old Brodnici' from Berladnici took part in the Battle of the Kalka River. At first they were on the Rus states' side, but at the start of the battle they betrayed their alliance by making a deal with the Mongol commanders."
 BDI_idea_7_desc: "In the 13th century Berladnici started to be mercenaries on duty in different countries. They made profitable agreements to develop their country. One of the most famous agreements was with Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria who came to the Bulgarian throne by Brodnici and Berladnici support in 1217."
 #Moldavian Ducal
 molducal_idea_1_desc: "The Moldavia region has many ancient cities. Some of them were founded in Roman times, others during the Slavic migration, but the most famous of them is Yekimoutskoye Gorodishche. It was founded in the early 9th century and had existed for not more than 100 years. Nevertheless it was a prosperous city with new crafts and social policies."
 molducal_idea_2_desc: "Rus expansion influenced a lot of nearby countries, Moldavian duchies being a few of them. Russians settled in lands and made laws for our realm, and began to play an important role in all Moldavian states."
 molducal_idea_3_desc: "The Tatars taught our people that a light cavalry army can be extremely powerful in the right hands. Our breeders try to find the best horses for our army using techniques that we learned during the yoke."
 molducal_idea_4_desc: "The Orthodox faith spread in Moldavian lands with the Rus expansion. Many people discovered it to be suitable for them, so the Orthodox Church rapidly gained power in Moldavia."
 molducal_idea_5_desc: "The Dniester river runs through all Moldavian duchies. It is one of the main trade routes in the land, which connects the northern part of our region with the Black Sea. Controlling the Dniester coast can give our country more benefits."
 molducal_idea_6_desc: "Moldavia is usually divided in three states: Tara de Sus, Tara de Jos and Bessarabia. Establishing relations across all these areas can be truly influential and profitable for all states."
 molducal_idea_7_desc: "Hungarian rulers always showed their interests in Moldavian lands. During the 14th century they started to unite them under a single state that became the Hungarian march in 1359."
 #Yotvingia
 YTV_idea_1_desc: "The area of Sudovia was subdued by the Kievans in the 10th century as part of Kievan Rus. Now that we have broken free we still do not forget our old rulers, and use their title as a pretext for us to claim rule over the once great Kievan Rus."
 YTV_idea_6_desc: "During the Great Prussian Uprising from 1260-1274, Skomantas of Yotvingia closely assisted the Prussian rebels on several occasions, rapidly moving from one area to another."
 #PruthenianDucal
 pruthenian_idea_4_desc: "Parts of our Pruthenia are converted by the Christian foes; we need to resist their conversions!"
 pruthenian_idea_6_desc: "The Pruthenian peoples may have been far behind in technology, but they had morale as high as their western counterparts."
 pruthenian_idea_7_desc: "Pruthenians specialized in shock combat, and they exploited their own strength against the enemy using their tactics."
 #Dassel
 DSS_idea_1_desc: "The property sales are breaking up the country. These endanger our functioning state and our existence. We should regulate them before worse things happen."
 DSS_idea_3_desc: "Rainald von Dassel was the most important and influential member of the House von Dassel. He became dignitary of Hildesheim, Archbishop of Cologne and Archchancellor of Italy. He was a close advisor of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and had an important influence on Imperial politics and in the Italian conflict of Guelphs and Ghibellines. He supported, and even aggravated, the Hohenstaufen rejecting of Papal claims, and initiated the use of Sacrum Imperium or Holy Empire."
 DSS_idea_7_desc: "Hunnesrück was a small village near the old town of Dassel, where after the Thirty Years' War new administrative buildings were placed, although they could also be used as barracks mainly for cavalry units, as it was the place of an important stud farm."
 #Rheingraviate
 REI_idea_4: "Engraved in History"
 REI_idea_4_desc: "The line of Kyrburg, which originated from the Wildgrave lands, was at the beginning in feuds with other lines like the Dhaun line, and quickly inherited much land. Eventually they bore the title of Wild- and Rheingraf, and later they also acquired Obersalm and began titling themselves Count of Salm. Much of the Raugraviate was transferred to the electorate of the Palatinate."
 #Raugraviate
 SXM_idea_2: "Armed Conflicts of Stolzenburg"
 #Wildgraviate
 WGR_idea_2: "They Separated From Us!"
 WGR_idea_2_desc: "After the end of the Nahegau, we became its successor state. But because we were weakened, the county of Veldenz and the Raugraviate were able to become free, making us even weaker. We should reclaim these lands!"
 #SanMarino
 SMX_idea_5_desc: "The Statutes of 1600 were the first documents pertaining to the administration of the Republic. Soon after, the Republic signed a treaty with the Papal States guaranteeing its protection and independence. Though strained by later developments, this treaty lasted to nearly the end of the Papal States' existence as a political entity."
 #Merania
 XME_idea_5_desc: "The control of ports on a busy inland sea exposes one to numerous plagues and diseases. Learning from Italian neighbors, the Meranian subjects demonstrate an adeptness at naval management and warfare. From quarantines to cannon fire, a master can be found in any Meranian port."
 XME_idea_7_desc: "When Pope and Emperor took arms against each other for the second time since the Investiture Controversy, under the rule of the Hohenstaufens, the Dukes of Merania decided to stay loyal to their nominal overlord, the Bishop of Bamberg. Though this earned Duke Otto an Imperial Ban and the confiscation of all territories, none could say Merania was disloyal to the true faith."
 #Catalan Ducal
 catducal_idea_3_desc: "The county of Cerdanya descended from Wilfred the Hairy and the Bellonids. Even up to the second millennium, Cerdanya maintained the legal traditions of the Carolingian Franks - Salic Law - and that of the Visigoths who preceded them. A sophisticated judicial system consisted of both Judices and Boni Homines, who presided over trials."
 catducal_idea_6_desc: "With the accession of Hugh Capet in 987, the Catalan counties refused to pay homage to the new dynasty, fostering more of a connection with their fellow Iberian states in the form of Navarra and Aragon. Over the ensuing centuries, despite the expansion of the counts of Barcelona and the Aragonese kings, many smaller Catalan counties retained their independence. Even after they were absorbed, the Catalans sought free rule and special privileges."
 #Skane
 SKN_idea_1_desc: "The 'Ear-Sound' is first attested in Norse writing at the turn of the second millennium. The narrow waterway commands trade between the whole Baltic Sea and the rest of the world, making its control invaluable. Skania is centered upon some of its most important ports, such as Lund and Malmø. We should use this to our advantage."
 SKN_idea_2_desc: "Originally, Skania was made up of five tribal units or Thanedoms, consisting of disorganized farmers. The first Danish king Haraldr united the region in the tenth century, overseeing its Christianization. Haraldr was the greatest of Scandinavian rulers, and a great asset to the true faith. Now that we have regained our independence, we Skanians should model our society after his vision!"
 SKN_idea_4_desc: "In 1425 a Franciscan monastery in Lund opened a university, dubbed 'the Academy'. Though it was eventually shut down in the wake of the reformation, it contributed greatly to the scholasticism of the region. In 1666, a spiritual successor was established in the form of the Regia Academia Caroline, which continued to educate Skania's citizens."
 SKN_idea_5_desc: "Establishing a Baltic Sea Dominion over the sea's entire coastline is the goal of all Scandinavian rulers. Due to its crucial position on the borderland between Denmark and Sweden, Skania has seen many battles on land and sea, and was endlessly fought over by foreign powers. Now that we have learned from these various attempted invasions, we can realize our own aspirations of dominance."
 SKN_idea_7_desc: "The Swedes have desperately tried to stamp out Skanian culture, depriving us of our history and our dialect. We must resist their imperialistic advances and ensure our culture survives."
 #Székelyföld
 SZK_idea_5_desc: "The icons of the Sun and Moon have been important to Magyars since the original conquest of the Carpathian basin. After the Christianization of the Kingdom, these symbols lost some of their significance, except for in Székelyland, where they are still in use."
 SZK_idea_7_desc: "Surrounded by Orthodox Christians and eventually Calvinists, the Székelys remained loyal to the Catholic Church. We are a city upon a hill, a beacon of light in the valley of the shadow of death."
 #Királyföld
 KLY_idea_4_desc: "After the Mongols devastated our lands in the thirteenth century, our towns invested in fortified churches with massive walls. Many have fallen into disrepair over the centuries as we grew decadent under the demise of the Hordes' power. It would be foolish, however, to let a great pre-existing defensive infrastructure go to waste, when there are still enemies stirring on all sides."
 #Wendish
 wendish_idea_1_desc: "The Germans pushed the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire beyond the Elbe in the tenth century, establishing the Northern March and the Billung March. This all changed, however, in AD 983, when the Lutici and the Obotriti led a unilateral uprising against their foreign occupiers. Many Christian sites were plundered, and the Empire's control beyond the Elbe collapsed completely."
 wendish_idea_6_desc: "The Rani, occupying the island of Rügen, were one of the most powerful Wendish tribes, and the only tribe to style their ruler as a King. Even more honored than the king, however, was the high oracle Priest, called the Drvovid. Such elevation of Church over State attests to the sophistication of Wendish government structures."
 wendish_idea_7_desc: "German can be heard throughout the Wendish cities, and Christians practice their faith throughout the lands. Though these foreign impositions may cover up our old ways of life, certain aspects will forever live on through syncretic traditions."
 #Livonian
 livonian_idea_2_desc: "Prehistoric geological processes resulted in the Pruthenian and Livonian coasts being rich with Amber, which was at times valued even more than Gold. By expanding our collection of coastal Amber deposits, we can turn Livonia into an economic powerhouse through trade down the Amber Road."
 livonian_idea_3_desc: "Among the southern Livonian tribes, the Latgalians were the most advanced, holding extensive connections with the Orthodox Rus of Polotsk. Organized Christian principalities like Koknese and Jersika emerged on Latgalian land, who could deftly negotiate with European crusaders to avoid the devastation of their territories and attain mutually beneficial deals. The Latgalians would go on to form the basis of Latvia itself as they assimilated their neighboring tribes."
 livonian_idea_7_desc: "The Enlightenment held significant sway in later Latvia, inspiring a Latvian nationalist movement. The Baltic German author Garlieb Merkel embodied the national sentiment in his book 'Die Letten Vorzüglich in Liefland am Ende des Philosophischen Jahrhunderts: Ein Beytrag zur Völker und Menschenkunde', which explained the oppression of the Latvian serfs under foreign rule. Latvians would not tolerate the same conditions under Russian rule."
 #Samogitia
 ZMG_idea_4_desc: "Samogitia, sandwiched between the Teutonic and Livonian Order, seemed ripe for conquest - however, when the armies entered they returned decisively defeated on several occasions by the skilled Samogitian armies. One defeat at Saule in 1236 was so severe for the Livonian Brothers of the Sword that they were forced to seek protection from the Teutonic Order, effectively ending their independence."
 #Galloway
 MAF_idea_4_desc: "Fergus was our greatest leader, and a statesman of considerable repute. By arranging a marriage with the Crovans, he became their agnatic progenitor, and then forged alliances with the English to stave over Scottish power. His actions, diplomatically, militarily, and ecclesiastically, are prolific - we should all aspire to emulate him."
 MAF_idea_5: "Battle of the Standard"
 #Pruthenia
 PTH_idea_7_desc: "The defeat of the disorganized army during the Napoleonic Wars shocked the Prussian establishment, which had largely felt invincible after the Frederician victories. While Stein and Hardenberg began modernizing the Prussian state, Scharnhorst began to reform the military. He led a Military Reorganization Committee, which included Gneisenau, Grolman, Boyen, and the civilians Stein and Könen. Clausewitz assisted with the reorganization as well. Dismayed by the populace's indifferent reaction to the 1806 defeats, the reformers wanted to cultivate patriotism within the country."
 #South Slavic
 sslav_idea_3_desc: "With the waning of Greek Patriarchal authority, many self-governing churches sprang up across the Balkans. The Bosnians, for example, separated from both Rome and Constantinople, surviving multiple Crusades and attempts by Hungary to impose Catholic rule. We must join with our Slavic brethren and establish our own autocephalous church."
 #Hungarian Ducal
 hunduc_idea_3_desc: "We may be quite separated from those original Magyars who brought Dacia to its knees, but their military stratagems live on within us. One more time shall the Magyar cavalry ride across the plains of Eastern Europe, exacting tribute from our cowering neighbors."
 hunduc_idea_4_desc: "The Royal realm made extensive use of buffer states along the Carpathian mountains and the Danube, establishing various semi-independent polities under the rule of an appointed 'Ban', usually from a local noble family but sometimes from the core Magyar lands. We should implement this tactic in our own lands to hold the precarious borderlands."
 #Wallachian Ducal
 walduc_idea_3_desc: "The enormous Kingdom of Hungary attempted to subjugate the Wallachian people in the 1300s, sending 30,000 troops with King Charles at the head. A tiny force of cavalry and local peasants met the challenge, crushing the Hungarian army in a devastating ambush. This decisive victory engenders our national ethos."
 #Marches
 marches_idea_4_desc: "Roger Mortimer was the most powerful of the Marcher Lords, holding extensive allodial titles across Wales and Ireland. He became so powerful, he effectively ruled England in tandem with his mistress Isabella - the wife of the English King Edward II. Eventually, Edward's son built up enough support to wrestle back control of his kingdom from Mortimer, and had him executed, sparing his mother's life. Ironic - he could save others from death, but not himself."
 #Polish Ducal
 polduc_idea_2_desc: "Before the unification of Poland into one Christian state, there were Slavic tribal units in its present lands. The Silesians, Mazovians, Vistulans, Polans, and Pomeranians were the main powers, and they each live on in the names of our duchies. Though the distinctions have blurred, we are essentially nominal ethnostates."
 #Wied
 WDX_idea_2_desc: "The Counts of Wied had always had good relations with the Pfalzgraves, as they had long been fiefs, and even thereafter the Palatinate continued to support Wied. This led to numerous advantages, like receiving Ledigmann as a vassal."
 WDX_idea_3_desc: "In order to attract more inhabitants to the slow-growing newly-founded city of Neuwied, the Count gave the city in a charter numerous freedoms, including the right to elect their Magistrate or to collect taxes, but most exceptionally for that time, the right to a broad religious freedom. Many people fled from other counties to Neuwied due to religious intolerance. In the 18th century, seven different religious communities lived in Neuwied: Calvinists, Lutherans, Catholics, Mennonites, Inspirationalists, Herrnhuters and Jews."
 WDX_idea_5_desc: "The Counts of Wied recognized the value of education and encouraged education to the best of their ability. Already in 1616, an edict was issued, which ordered compulsory schooling in the County. Since then Wied has always been a very important center of education with its numerous schools."
 WDX_idea_7_desc: "The immigrants, persecuted in other places, brought in many new production goods and skills, giving Wied an economic prosperity and contributed to a comparatively early industrialization. The furniture and watches produced in Neuwied were highly demanded by other courts. But also steel was a very important export product: it was for example used to build the first German railroad."
 #Passau
 PAA_idea_1_desc: "The villages of Wollaberg, Heindlschlag, Hintereben, Jandelsbrunn, Rosenberg, Aßberg and Grund, together with the area of Wilderranna, formed a large enclave and important foothold in the Austrian lands. The Bishops of Passau frequently founded new villages, expanding their territory and influence. Much later, when most of the Passauer land was lost due to the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, the bishops only held some villages they once founded in Bohemia."
 PAA_idea_5_desc: "These type of churches already existed, but were rarely used and often only for small churches or as parts of larger buildings. The crucial breakthrough in the creation of the wall-pillar church took place mainly in Passau, as they wanted to erect a lot more churches to impress their rival Salzburg. Wall-pillar churches allowed relatively large, wide areas to be built cheaply and quickly from bricks or rumble."
 PAA_idea_7_desc: "The Diocese of Passau is much older than the neighboring dioceses, as Passau can be considered as the successor of the ancient Roman diocese of Lorch. It was also one of the earliest states to gain princely powers.\n\nWe are, or to be more correct, were the largest diocese of the Holy Roman Empire, stretching even into Hungary, but the Pope, Austria Bavaria and all the other neighbors don't seem to care about us, and just took away much of our influence to create more dioceses like Vienna. We should solve this militarily."
 #Salzburg
 SLZ_idea_1_desc: "The Hallein Salt Mine, also known as Salzbergwerk Dürrnberg, is an underground salt mine located in the Dürrnberg plateau. The mine has been worked for over 7,000 years since the time of the Celtic tribes and earlier. It helped ensure nearby Salzburg would become a powerful trading community, even its name comes from this mined resource."
 SLZ_idea_4_desc: "The Primas Germaniae is a title of honor for the most important Roman Catholic bishop in the German Lands. Mainz was the first to have this title. Many other also claimed the title, like we, however, they all lost the Primate dignity, leaving us alone to bear this title!"
 SLZ_idea_5_desc: "Protestant tendencies revealed themselves vigorously in the Bishopric, supported and promoted by the Protestant members of the imperial estates. In imitation of the Corpus Evangelicorum, the Lutherans of the Salzburg territory formed a league, binding themselves by oath and an outward rite of mutual sprinkling of salt. The Archbishop did all he could; he invited the Jesuits as missionaries, and engaged the help of the Emperor. Later he enforced the Decree of the Religious Peace of Augsburg: recantation or emigration. In ten years about 30,000 people left the territory and settled in East Prussia, or in Württemberg or Hanoverian territory; a few emigrated to Georgia in North America."
 SLZ_idea_7_desc: "The Salzburger government did not attach importance to the complaints of several traders about the reselling of used items causing unfair competition. These lax laws, together with the already large commercial importance, made of Salzburg an important center of second-hand trade. It remained unregulated for almost a whole existence of the Salzburger State."
 #Dannenberg
 DDD_idea_2_desc: "It is said that the Danish king Valdemar II and his son were captured and held as prisoners in the tower of Dannenberg. This tower received the name of Waldemarturm because of that."
 DDD_idea_3_desc: "The Jeetzel River has the tendency to frequently flood the town of Dannenberg. This caused the town to have a small and stretched shape, but it also provided defence against attackers, as the castle was built close to it."
 DDD_idea_4_desc: "The Saint John's Church of Dannenberg is one of the few old buildings it has, dating from 1385, although it has been renovated many times. Just like nearly everyone converted to Protestantism, this church became a Protestant one."
 DDD_idea_6_desc: "In 1608, a major fire struck the town of Dannenberg, destroying all buildings except for the church and the Waldemarturm. There are no buildings left from before the 17th century. This however cleared up space for newer and better buildings."
 DDD_idea_7_desc: "In the early 14th century, the Duke of Dannenberg sold it's County to Lüneburg, ending it's existence. In the middle of the 16th century however, some members of a sideline of the Dannenberg family managed to regain power over a slightly larger independent Dannenberg. But this line soon became extinct in the middle of the 17th century, ending its existence again and going back to Lüneburg."
 #Disentis
 DXS_idea_1_desc: "These two local saints were the founders of the Abbey of Disentis. Sigisbert was a wandering Frankish monk, and Placidus was the local landowner who supported Sigisbert. The ruler of Chur, distrusting the two, murdered Placidus to prevent a loss of land. It did not help: Disentis became independent and controlled a very large estate. It is also one of the oldest monasteries of Southern Germany and Switzerland."
 DXS_idea_3_desc: "Near the secluded village of Trons, somewhere in its thick forests, the best and most hardy men of the surroundings assembled to talk about justice, the love for liberty and humanity. The Abbot favored them with advice and his authority."
 DXS_idea_4_desc: "The monastery was often the site of hard-fought battles because of its strategic location on a mountain pass, connecting the Leagues to the rest of Switzerland."
 DXS_idea_5_desc: "In an act to stop internal wars and to focus more on defending against expanding empires, the many rulers of the Grischa region formed the Grey League. Disentis had an important role in its formation, and would become a very important member."
 DXS_idea_6_desc: "In the tenth century, Disentis controlled the most important passage in a large area. However, the Gothard route was laid, and a lot of the traders went through that route instead of going through Disentis. This marked the end of our prosperity. We should change that and let the trade again go through Disentis."
 DXS_idea_7_desc: "Disentis used its printing press to spread Romansh spiritual literature, and they also made the first Catholic Romansh Bible, the Bibla da Cuera. Disentis became the cultural center of the Catholic Romansh people."
 #Mainz
 MAI_idea_1_desc: "The Archbishop-Elector of Mainz was also the Archchancellor of Germany (the others being over Burgundy and Italy), and was as such ranked first among all the ecclesiastical and secular princes of the Empire, and was second only to the Emperor.\nIt served a considerable role as intermediary between the estates of the Empire. It was the Archbishop of Mainz who would call the electors together for an election, who accept the new Emperor and exercises control over the Reichstag archives. He was formally the most important member of the Reichstag."
 MAI_idea_3_desc: "The Archbishop of Mainz maintained one of the largest military households among the ecclesiastical magnates in Medieval Germany. For the Indiculus Loricatorum, a reinforcement consisting of heavy knights requested by Otto II for his campaign in Italy, Mainz gave one of the highest number of cavalrymen, even if they had already sent many. However, the military importance of the Mainzer army had severely declined in modern times."
 MAI_idea_4_desc: "Mainz lays at the confluence of the Rhine and the Main Rivers, two major transportation corridors, granting Mainz a position as major river port. Starting from the Roman times, Mainz was an important place regarding connections by road, having branches towards Trier and Metz.\nIn modern times, it held an even more important position, as it also controlled the roads between Magdeburg, Saxony, Hessen and Franconia, and thus secured the route from Pomerania into central Germany. It also connected many other cities, like Würzburg to Regensburg."
 MAI_idea_5_desc: "Mainz held an important position in Rheingau region, which is regarded as one of the best vineyard areas of the Empire, and much of this wine passed through Mainz. The town further also lays in a fertile territory, and there was an extensive agricultural activity meant for export, like fruit, tobacco hemp, millet, but especially grain.\nHowever, Mainz, unlike Frankfurt, was less a commercial center but more a distribution center for goods.\nMainz had the right to oblige that all goods had to be unloaded and offered for sale for at least three days before being transported. The Bishop secured the fees for them as receipts for the state fund. These were collected in the so-called Brand zu Mainz building."
 #Tubingen
 TUB_idea_2_desc: "The Count of Tübingen received the title of Count Palatine due to services rendered to the first Hohenstaufen King of Germany. As Count Palatine, the Count was granted the right to collect customs, the right to mint coins, the right to exercise judicial powers in the King's stead and hunting rights."
 TUB_idea_3_desc: "The first mention of Tübingen was when emperor Henry IV tried, and failed, to siege the city. Its castle is named Hohentübingen. Several members of the family served here as Schlosskommandant or castle commander."
 TUB_idea_4_desc: "The Counts Palatine of Tübingen founded many monasteries, the most notable being the abbeys of Bebenhausen and of Blaubeuren. But several factors contributed to an economic decline of the county, most importantly due to their extravagant donations to the monasteries they founded. To gain time to pay off his debts to Bebenhausen Abbey, the control of Böblingen and Calw were transferred to the abbey. An Imperial City, in a sign of gratitude, paid off his debts and so he regained control. But other members of the family were also heavily indebted. Eventually the most important territories were sold (like the city of Tübingen) or donated to Bebenhausen Abbey, ending the existence of the County."
 TUB_idea_5_desc: "For centuries Tübingen had been under the rule of the Duchy of Württemberg. This had some side-effects, like converting early to Protestantism, being dragged into the many wars of the Duchy, or serving as a military base."
 TUB_idea_6_desc: "One of the most significant events in Tübingen's history is the founding of the Ebenhard Karls University by Duke Ebenhard of Württemberg in 1477, making it one of the oldest universities in Central Europe. It soon became renowned as one of the most influential places of learning in the Holy Roman Empire, especially for theology. A Protestant faculty followed later."
 TUB_idea_7_desc: "In 1798 the Allgemeine Zeitung, a leading newspaper in early 19th-century Germany, was founded in Tübingen. It was widely recognized as the first world class German journal and is a symbol of the German press abroad. The tradition of the newspaper is maintained by the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and the Allgemeine Zeitung edited in Mainz."
 #Magdeburg
 MAG_idea_1_desc: "In 1188, archbishop Wichmann granted the city of Magdeburg city privileges, and has since then been adopted by surrounding German cities, but also spread as far as Bohemia and is still spreading further eastwards. As experts we are often called to decide controversial questions regarding the Magdeburg Rights. These rights contain various trade and merchant rights, marital laws, the abolition of kin liability and the installation of a tribunal."
 MAG_idea_3_desc: "After the adoption of a more evangelical approach to Christianity, we have fought with verve to protect these new teachings have refused to make any concessions even under military pressure. Impressed by our religious zeal, various disciples of this new approach have honored us with the title Ünseres Herrgotts Kanzlei our lord's chancellery."
 MAG_idea_5_desc: "Our land and city was completely devastated during the so-called Magdeburg Wedding by our intolerant opponents. This coined the phrase Magdeburgization for such a terror. But if we now gave up and dissuaded from the right path, they would ultimately win. Therefore, we will rebuild our city and land to even excel our former glory!"
 MAG_idea_6_desc: "Since we have dissolved Magdeburg's Abbey of St. Augustine and made the latter's library publicly accessible for our citizens, the pursuit of knowledge has become a goal of a lot of burghers. One example is Otto von Guericke who made an impressive experiment showing how air pressure works and giving another proof for the existence of vacua. To do so, he connected two airtight half spheres and evacuated the hollow space in between with a pump. Thereafter, eight horses on each side weren't able to pull apart the sphere; only after air flowed in again were the horses able to do so."
 #Oldenburg
 OLD_idea_1_desc: "The Oldenburg dynasty came to rule as kings of Denmark in the 1440s and would rule the kingdom from there onwards."
 OLD_idea_2_desc: "We control only a small amount of land which at the coast gets flooded. Therefore we have to build dikes at crucial positions to make more land arable and to connect some of our more remote lands with our capital."
 OLD_idea_4_desc: "We have decreed that a market, the Michaelmas Market, shall be now held every year at the end of the harvest season. Five days starting from the Saturday before Michaelmas Day, the 27th of September, domestic and foreign merchants will be able to buy various goods for sale strengthening our trade."
 OLD_idea_6_desc: "Although we were granted the privilege to tariff ships passing the toll station at Elseth which is the last toll station before the mouth of the river Weser, the emperor had to help us to bend Bremen's will to accept this toll. Since we have to operate many dikes and a lighthouse at the isle of Wangerooge, this toll seems justified to us. Now, the additional ducats will fill our treasury!"
 OLD_idea_7_desc: "Ever since time immemorial, Oldenburg was only a county. But now that we have expanded and claimed other land titles, the time is at hand to proclaim the Duchy of Oldenburg. Now, we will no longer be looked down on by dukes owning less land than we do!"
 #Styria
 STY_idea_1_desc: "When in 1276 Styrian and Carinthian nobles swore an oath to emperor Rudolf I von Habsburg at the abbey of Rein close to Graz, the centuries-long reign of the Habsburgs in Styria and the rest of Austria began. If at every coronation all of our nobles pledge their allegiance to our ruler, their support of our reign will be guaranteed, legitimising our sovereignty."
 STY_idea_2_desc: "The defense of our frontiers is a serious issue, not so much how to do it but how to pay for it. The solution we have hit upon it to make generous land grants on the frontier to build up a professional military class. Not only will this ensure our frontier is adequately defended at a reasonable price but these men will be available for other tasks."
 STY_idea_3_desc: "For a long time, there were exclaves of clerical territories amidst Styria. We have been able to negotiate an agreement with the corresponding rulers. From now on we will be the worldly sovereign being able to tax and raise troops in these regions. However, these territories will still belong to their lordships, and they will still be responsible for all judicial matters."
 STY_idea_5_desc: "For a long time our iron industry was decentralized and was split into many different facilities often taking care of only one production step. Whereas, the foundation of the Innerberger Hauptgewerkschaft will lead to the whole production and trade being managed centrally benefiting our iron production."
 #Bamberg
 BBB_idea_1_desc: "Emperor Henry IV. established Diocese of Bamberg as exempt at the Synod of Frankfurt in 1007. As we are also the director of the Circle of Franconia, we can pursue an independent policy even in worldly matters in our region."
 BBB_idea_2_desc: "Our cathedral dating back to 1004 is not only the resting place for the sole Holy Roman Emperor couple, Henry IV and Cunigunde, but also the only preserved grave of a Pope in Germany. Pope Clement II, the former second Bishop of Bamberg, was deeply-rooted with our city, so that during his papacy he stayed Bishop of Bamberg and wished to be buried there. Truly, our influence reaches Rome."
 BBB_idea_3_desc: "Since the introduction of the communal brew privilege, the number of breweries has increased rapidly. However, some misuse this privilege and sell impurified beer. Thus let us declare that nothing else than malt, hops and water shall be used!"
 BBB_idea_4_desc: "Near the Regnitz many new houses were already built towards the riverside. Our citizens even use small gondolas for transportation and trading. We should encourage even more to settle there."
 BBB_idea_5_desc: "Die stra der zauberey: Item so jemandt den leuten durch zauberey schaden oder nachtheyl zufuegt, soll man straen vom leben zum todt, vnnd man soll solch stra mit dem fewer thun.\nTranslation:\nThe punishment of sorcery: Moreover if someone harmed the people with sorcery or caused to the people's disadvantage, one should punish from life to death, and one should execute the punishment with fire."
 BBB_idea_7_desc: "In 1445 and 1446 a shepherd had two visions of fourteen children revealing themselves as the Fourteen Holy Helpers near Lichtenfels, and a terminally ill maid was miraculously cured. Ever since, the amount of pilgrims increased and now has reached a scale that the old, small church is no longer able to sustain. Commissioning the famous architect Balthasar Neumann to build a new rococo church would not only help to create enough space but also show the greatness of God making the devotion of our poor subordinate souls thrive!"
 #Bayreuth
 NUO_idea_2_desc: "In 1427, our city's council bought the ruins of the Burgrave's Castle from the Hohenzollern. Now the whole castle belongs to our city, so we will renovate and then use the barracks and the Imperial Stable to accommodate our own soldiers."
 NUO_idea_3_desc: "Among our citizens are notable scientists like Hartmann Schedel, writer of a biblical paraphrase and world history. This chronicle named after our city is sought across all of Europe. We truly have profound knowledge of the whole world!"
 NUO_idea_4_desc: "Our sausage is among the best and most famous in the Empire and already has centuries of tradition. Let us regulate the size and the price of our Rostbratwurst in an order of butchers to increase productivity!"
 NUO_idea_5_desc: "Nuremberg's citizens always were open to new ideas and already follow the new faith from the north. Thus we should embrace the Protestants, and found a school in honor of the reformers."
 NUO_idea_7_desc: "After the signing of the Peace of Westphalia, the peace executional congress assembled in our city. We should use this opportunity to make contacts with all European nations."
 #Augsburg
 AUG_idea_1_desc: "Since 952 our city already housed many imperial diets like the one before emperor Henry IV.'s Walk to Canossa. During these diets representatives of every imperial prince and free city come to our city. We will now use this opportunity to strengthen our diplomatic relations across the whole Holy Roman Empire."
 AUG_idea_2: "City of the Fuggers and Welsers"
 AUG_idea_2_desc: "The Fuggers and Welsers are merchant families from our city, which make money from cloth and mining. Building up their power they are now among the wealthiest houses of Europe, and now finance kings and emperors. They will certainly help their home if needed!"
 AUG_idea_3_desc: "In 1530 the Confessio Augustana was presented to Emperor Charles IV during an imperial diet which was called as an attempt to restore religious unity in the Holy Roman Empire and fight off the Turks. This was the basis of the new faith also called Protestantism. Let us now accept all Christians regardless of their denomination!"
 AUG_idea_4_desc: "One of our families is so successful that they now build houses for the poor. Because the annual rent is only 1 Rhenish guilder, everyone can afford a home, so there are less homeless making revolts less likely."
 AUG_idea_5_desc: "A cake made with plums and crumbles is now very popular in our lands. Because of the name Zwetschgendatschi some already ridicule us as Datschiburg. We should promote our specialty even outside of our borders, so more of those will be sold!"
 AUG_idea_6_desc: "Augsburg's architecture already prospered during the Renaissance with a new town hall and many fountains. However, now even more was built in the new Rococo style, so that this style is even called Augsburg Style in the German lands in honor of us."
 AUG_idea_7_desc: "After 30 years of war, religious suppression and occupation of our city, there is finally peace. Let us therefore forget the troubles of the past! Our children will also receive illustrations called Friedensgemälde to remind them of the horrors of war."
 #Rothenburg
 ROE_idea_1_desc: "In 1274, emperor Rudolf I of Habsburg granted Rothenburg the free city status and later on, in 1352 emperor Charles IV made us immediate to the empire and granted us the high justice. Although this excludes nobles, during the past and especially during wars, we charged and prosecuted even our noble enemies. Some may say this to be insane, but for us it represents our independence and juristic understanding that common nobles are not better than our free city. Both are represented through our sigil with the red castle and the court arbor for our right to high justice."
 ROE_idea_2_desc: "During the reign of mayor Heinrich Toppler at the end of the 14th century, the territory of Rothenburg dramatically increased. This was achieved by systematically acquiring castles, forests and villages from impoverished nobles whose downfall sometimes was even orchestrated by the city council. Although this led to the formation of a coalition, the council of Rothenburg was able to secure the gained land, but thereafter new acquisitions had to be restrained. However decades after these events, the moment is at hand to continue with Rothenburg's expansion!"
 ROE_idea_3_desc: "After our huge land acquisitions, we have to protect them from looting and from our enemies. Therefore, we will construct moats and walls, plant impenetrable hedges and let them maintained by experts called Hegemeister. Although these defensive lines can not hinder big armadas from entering our lands, they still impede those and give us enough time to arm and mobilize our armies."
 ROE_idea_4_desc: "We have to learn from the disastrous coalition which formed after the land acquisitions during Toppler's time, and prevent our neighbours from joining a war against us and instead play them out against each other. The Circle of Franconia is after the one of Swabia the most fragmented circle in the empire and consists out of clerical rulers, free cities and secular rulers. Therefore, it is of highest importance to establish and maintain good relations with our neighbours."
 ROE_idea_5_desc: "According to a legend, when after combat the general of the Catholic League, Tilly, was able to breach our city's walls on the 30th of October, 1631, Tilly wanted to execute four high-ranking city council members for Rothenburg's resistance. However during the wait for the executioner, wine served in gigantic steins of over 3 litres in volume was given to Tilly and his soldiers. Impressed by the size of the steins, Tilly made a joking comment that he would pardon the council members if one of them was able to empty one of the steins in one gulp. As the former mayor Nusch was able to do so, Tilly fulfilled his joking promise and pardoned the city."
 ROE_idea_6: "Wine Land of the Tauber Valley"
 ROE_idea_6_desc: "The lovely Tauber valley and Rothenburg are the southern part of the Franconian vineyards. As we now control large parts of these, we can now compete with the vineyards around the river Main and so we are an equal trade partner. Therefore, both regions will profit from trading, and we might even be able to secure the privilege to bottle our vine into Bocksbeutel, a remarkable and famous ellipsoid bottle."
 ROE_idea_7_desc: "Our bakers have created small ball like pastry called Schneeballen, because they look like snowballs. They are made out of short pastry through cutting the dough into small slices and twirling it around with a spoon. Thereafter they are boiled in fat and then powdered with sugar. Now already for years, they are eaten during festivals like Christmas and weddings and have become an integral part of our traditions."
 #South German Confederation
 SGC_idea_1: "South German Heritage"
 SGC_idea_1_desc: "The South German Confederation is a dreamt of country, which exists now and people are willing to die for their country to the last man, as they are conscious of their South German heritage."
 SGC_idea_2_desc: "Southern parts of the historical Holy Roman Empire were home to many banking families, among them Fuggers and Rothschilds to name the most famous, therefore the finances are well looked after."
 SGC_idea_3_desc: "The most striking difference among the Germans in the south opposed to the northerners is their easygoing nature enjoying their traditional ways of life."
 SGC_idea_4_desc: "There are numerous protected cultural industries in South Germany, whose products are often bought in neighbouring countries."
 SGC_idea_5_desc: "The military legacy of the Military Circles left a significant mark in the defense of the countries, but now united, they can make it even more efficient."
 SGC_idea_6_desc: "There is no doubt that the world knows about the Grand Duchy of Baden, The Kingdom of Bavaria, The Kingdom of Swabia and The Archduchy of Austria, therefore no one can truly usurp the right of the dynasty sitting on the throne."
 SGC_idea_7_desc: "Numerous universities and high quality education makes our advisors wanted abroad, but thanks to their patriotism, they are willing to use their skills for their country without any hesitation."
 #North German Confederation
 NGC_idea_1_desc: "The North German Confederation was formed under Prussian leadership and therefore included the combined military might not only that of Prussia, but also of its other members, now united in the common goal of unifying Germany into one state."
 NGC_idea_2_desc: "The elimination of customs barriers was one of the wisest decisions made by the German Confederation. Companies become richer as they don't have to suffer from puny tariffs and we can tax them even more."
 #Feadha
 FWS_idea_2_desc: "Traditionally, Gaelic law states that any male relations sharing the great-grandmother of the dying chief would be eligible for 'acclamation' as the next chief, thus allowing our wide and strong dynasty to remain in power."
 FWS_idea_4_desc: "For time immemorial, the Fews have been host to rich apple trees. This has allowed our citizens to stay healthy and happy due to the surplus of food."
 #Monaco
 MCO_idea_4_desc: "To increase the prestige of our state, Lord Honoré II sought the elevation of Monaco to a Principality, a privileged rank afforded to few rulers in Europe. He renovated the Rock by constructing the Princely Palace, complete with robust defenses, a chapel, pool, mirror gallery, and priceless artwork like Murano chandeliers and Jan Brueghel paintings. With a princely title, kingship is almost within our grasp!"
 MCO_idea_6_desc: "Italian Unification had a profound effect on Monaco. Several cities, such as Menton and Roquebrune, revolted against the Prince in an attempt to federate with the rest of Italy. Though they were ultimately annexed to France in the Treaty of 1861, Monte Carlo and Monaco itself were reconfirmed in their sovereign independent status. Like San Marino, we escaped the fate that befell virtually every other Italian city."
 #Siena
 SIE_idea_3_desc: "Siena's riches in the Middle Ages were often tied to its banks. From 1287 to 1355 the city was directly ruled by prominent banker families, a period which came to be called the 'Noveschi'. Under this mercantile guidance, the city reached the apex of its power and stability."
 #Nice
 NIC_idea_5_desc: "After 1713, when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed, Nice was firmly re-attached to Savoy and a period of peace followed. In this time, work began on the construction of a 'New Town', fit with all the trappings of a sleek, contemporary Enlightenment city."
 #Lucca
 LUC_idea_4_desc: "At last, we are free from foreign occupation! For decades, our city was passed and sold like a commodity, but finally under decree from Emperor Charles IV, we are liberated from Pisan control!"
 LUC_idea_5_desc: "At the battle of Altopascio it was Luccan cavalry that routed the Guelph army, preventing them from escaping. Meanwhile a Ghibelline counter-attack together with our help crushed the Guelph forces."
 LUC_idea_6_desc: "While Dante Alighieri was born in Florence, their aristocracy was not very tolerant of his later works, and so he was exiled. During his exile, signor Alighieri resided within Lucca for a long time, and we are proud to host a poet such as him."
 #Florence
 LAN_idea_4_desc: "The Medici bank was founded in 1396 by Giovanni de' Medici and for decades held hegemony over Europe. The bank funded operations of Artists and Nobility alike across the continent, and given its unprecedented size, several new administrative innovations were devised, including the Leger and Double-Entry systems."
 LAN_idea_5_desc: "'Religions are man-made, but integral to the functioning of a society', so were the words of Machiavelli. Born in Florence, Niccolò Machiavelli and his Philosophical writings brought countless new concepts to us, from aspects of Humanism, to an understanding of religion."
 #Piombino
 POB_idea_4_desc: "Though one does not think of the Barbary Coast as falling near Tuscany, Barbary pirates nevertheless devastated Elba, Piombino, and nearby surroundings with their raids. We must fortify against these raging infidels with coastal fortresses - construct the Torre Mozza and redouble the strength of our city walls!"
 #Ventimiglia
 VMG_idea_4_desc: "After Ventimiglia was lost to Provence, the brothers Guglielmo Pietro and Pietro Balbo moved the administrative center of the state to the inland city of Tenda, which had been a lordship under the pre-Lascarid rulers. Though Ventimiglia remained the official name, many knew the state as 'the County of Tenda', nestled in a more easily defensible alpine position."
 #Besancon 
 BSC_idea_1_desc: "The ancient capital of the Sequanni tribes was taken by Julius Caesar himself. After that, the place became an important military bastion which also had economic and cultural influence."
 BSC_idea_2_desc: "The city was a great trade center and it was not a mistake if the city has earned his nickname Chrysopolis from the 9th century to the 12th."
 BSC_idea_3_desc: "Utinam is the motto of the city. It means, 'If God wills', and represents the importance of the faith to the people of Besançon."
 BSC_idea_7_desc: "During the industrial era, Besançon became the world leader in watchmaking. The city's nickname is still used today: the French Capital of Watchmaking."
 #Tirol
 TIR_idea_3_desc: "Our territory is too close to the Alps, and we learned how to fight in these ruthless mountains. If we use this knowledge against our enemies who are invading us by crossing the Alps we can launch a lot of surprise attacks on them."
 TIR_idea_6_desc: "Everybody has a talent. And Italians' talent is being mercenaries. They fight war to war for money and they don't complain a single time. Currently there are too many Italian mercenaries, but because we are close to Italy, we can benefit from these mercenaries by hiring them."
 #Apulia
 APL_idea_1_desc: "Apulia's cities are founded by ancient Greeks, who were one of the most advanced people in the world. So if we can embrace their knowledge around founding cities, we can make our cities even more prosperous!"
 APL_idea_7_desc: "Having a Saracen neighbor is disgusting and dangerous. They might want to take our or other Christians' lands. So we must fight them and make them leave our home continent. Then we will convert all infidels they brought to Europe!"
 #Dauphine
 DAU_idea_1_desc: "Dauphine's most important cities are founded by bishops and they always had a big influence on our government. Even though we are not a theocracy, with our bishops' influence everyone can say we truly honor our religion."
 DAU_idea_5_desc: "We respect our people's rights. To protect their rights and stabilize the nation, Humbert II created the Conseil Delphinal, a military and judicial council. By doing that, our monarch became one of the rare rulers who gave up some of his powers for his people. With this council, our nation was greatly stabilized."
 #Pechenegs
 PHE_idea_2_desc: "Together with the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I, the Pechenegs won a destructive victory over the Magyars in 896. The Magyars then fled to Hungary and the Pechenegs settled in their former territory."
 PHE_idea_3_desc: "As more and more Pechenegs converted to Islam in the 11th century, a disastrous civil war broke out between the Muslim minority among the Pechenegs and the still pagan majority in which the Muslims won. We must pay a certain amount of tolerance to the different religions that our subjects belong to."
 PHE_idea_4_desc: "During the wars against the Kievan Rus, the Grand Prince Sviatoslav was beaten and captured by the Pechenegs. The Pecheneg Khan had the prince executed and made a drinking cup out of his skull."
 PHE_idea_5_desc: "After the Byzantine Empire was plundered by a Pecheneg army, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos assembled a mercenary army of Cumans to attack the Pechenegs. Since the Pechenegs had been surprised and their wives and children led with their army, it came to a bloody massacre. Survivors of the battle were executed or enlisted in the Byzantine army. The entire Pecheneg people were wiped out that day."
 PHE_idea_7_desc: "After the extermination by Byzantium, many of the remaining Pechenegs were settled on Hungary's external borders as border guards. We are experienced defenders!"
 #Cieszyn
 CIE_idea_1_desc: "The dynasty of the Cieszyn Piasts was one of the longest-lasting of the Piast branches. Founded in 1290 by Mieszko of Cieszyn, it lasted until 1653."
 CIE_idea_2: "Surrounded by Major Powers"
 CIE_idea_2_desc: "We need to be friends with Bohemia, Poland, Austria and Prussia if we want to survive as such a small duchy; perhaps diplomacy is the key?"
 CIE_idea_4: "Lessons of War"
 CIE_idea_4_desc: "Cieszyn has suffered greatly in many wars, particularly the Thirty Years' War; our people need determination so our duchy won't be played around with!"
 CIE_idea_6_desc: "Cieszyn became wealthy very quickly while under Habsburg rule. In 1774 the 'Imperial road' was built between Vienna and Lemberg, running through Cieszyn. Eventually, in 1805, when Vienna was in danger from Napoléon Bonaparte, the Austrian Imperial family moved to Cieszyn and declared it the capital of their Empire!"
 #Kujavia
 KUJ_idea_1: "Testament of Bolesław Wrymouth"
 KUJ_idea_1_desc: "The 1138 will of Bolesław III, called 'Wrymouth' for his deformed jaw, divided the recently strengthened Polish kingdom among his sons. It was from this decision that the Polish duchies emerged. Our ambition is to try to dominate Poland."
 KUJ_idea_2_desc: "Comita Minora were local councils in Polish lands that were essentially little 'gatherings' where any developments of towns was decided. Thanks to careful planning, we can build cheaper buildings."
 KUJ_idea_3: "Our Northern Neighbours"
 KUJ_idea_4_desc: "Nicolaus Copernicus inspired the local people to be more innovative and more open. We can take advantage of this and be more like him. Torun is attracting more and more great minds which can help us learn new technologies faster."
 KUJ_idea_5_desc: "The Teutonic state founded up north kills and forcibly converts Slavs and Balts to Christianity. However, if they become too powerful, we would be in danger. We can't let that happen; expanding into the Pomerelian coastline wouldn't be a bad idea, to protect our Slavic brethren against the Teutonic Knights. Since the Balts aren't Christian, it would be good to accept their religion to gain their trust."
 KUJ_idea_6: "Between Two Rivers"
 KUJ_idea_6_desc: "Our duchy is situated along the Wisla river, however on our eastern frontier flows the Notec, which provides us with a gateway to trading with HRE states. In 1774, there was even a canal built in Bydgoszcz connecting the two rivers."
 KUJ_idea_7_desc: "Copernicus left behind a legacy of being a true Renaissance man. Copernicus directed the defense of Olsztyn and Warmia during the Thirteen Years' War. Being born in Kujavia, our people seek to follow his example to defend our lands in case of an attack from any of our neighbours."
 #Opole
 OPO_idea_1: "Silesian Entrenchment"
 OPO_idea_1_desc: "As Poland and Silesia continue to crumble into smaller duchies, we need to protect ourselves from the other Piasts, and also from any outside invasions. It's only a matter of time before Bohemia or some Polish duchy will want to expand their influence into Silesia."
 OPO_idea_2: "Relocation of Opole Castle"
 OPO_idea_2_desc: "In the early 13th century, Duke Casimir I of Opole decided to move the settlement from Pasieka Island onto the right bank of the Oder river. All of the inhabitants had to be moved in order to make place for the castle that was eventually built in the place of the old city, attracting many merchants, particularly from the HRE."
 OPO_idea_3: "Crumbled Piast Realm"
 OPO_idea_3_desc: "As the Silesian duchies crumble and crumble, it wouldn't do any harm to get ourselves some vassals. We hold a legitimate claim not only to the entire Silesian land, but to the whole former Polish kingdom. The key is to use this opportunity fast before any of our cousins manage to do so."
 OPO_idea_4: "Satellite Towns"
 OPO_idea_4_desc: "The duchies of Cieszyn, Oswiecim, Ratibor and Opava are essentially satellite towns to us; the many bridges in these lands and our friendly relations with them allow us to march with our army to faraway lands and supply will be more widely available."
 OPO_idea_5: "A Confluence of Cultures"
 OPO_idea_6_desc: "As the old German Silesian song goes, 'One day I will return home'. The Silesians eagerly are conscripted into the army and fight for their Prince, who they hope one day will become a King."
 OPO_idea_7: "Silesian Venice"
 OPO_idea_7_desc: "Opole was, and still is known as the 'Venice of Silesia' due to having many bridges and canals in the city. Since Opole reminds others of a wealthy merchant state, why not embrace this reputation further?"
 #Glogów
 GLG_idea_1: "Constant Raids"
 GLG_idea_1_desc: "In 1157 Glogów was raided and burnt down by Friedrich Barbarossa. Later, during the Thirty Years War it was essentially a fortress which was besieged and conquered by Prussian, French, Russian, Swedish and Austrian armies. Having larger garrisons should secure our safety. In 1109 it was successfully defended from the attack of Heinrich V, so we need to go back to the way we used to organize our defenses."
 GLG_idea_2: "Dadosesani Legacy"
 GLG_idea_2_desc: "The Dadosesani, who were a sub-group of Silesians, founded Glogów and we, the Duchy of Glogów, are their successors. Little is known about them, but we know one thing: they were a powerful tribe and our neighbours envy us for our ancestors."
 GLG_idea_3_desc: "Grunberg (Zielona Góra) was founded by settlers from western German states and Flanders. The city grew rapidly and it was the 2nd largest city in our duchy. It was also the wealthiest, providing an influx of Western ideas into our duchy."
 GLG_idea_4_desc: "Premislaus II left his duchy of Wielkopolska to us after his death in 1304. However, due to our weakness, we couldn't push that claim. We can strike at Wielkopolska, but we need to find a good time to do so."
 GLG_idea_5_desc: "Kasper Elyan was the first person to bring the printing press into Silesia and use it. Although he printed in the wealthier city of Wroclaw, his prints were also famous in his hometown, Glogów."
 GLG_idea_6: "Grunberg Fires"
 GLG_idea_6_desc: "The large, overcrowded Grunberg had many fires. The first recorded fire was in 1456, and the largest one was in 1582. Then followed other major fires in 1608, 1627, 1631, 1651, 1689, 1735, 1793 and 5 more after that. We need better building methods and a more advanced system of dealing with fires."
 GLG_idea_7: "Glogów Copper"
 #Oswiecim
 OSW_idea_1_desc: "As one of the smallest of the Silesian Duchies, we can have deep, centralised ruling over our citizens and have a more efficient bureaucracy. This way we can attempt to strive for a greater Oswiecim."
 OSW_idea_2_desc: "Our close proximity to the largest city in the Piast lands allows us to learn great ideas from the 'Paris of the East'. Our army also knows that they are not only guarding our duchy, but also a pathway to a very important city in the region."
 OSW_idea_3: "Fertile Lands of Zator"
 OSW_idea_3_desc: "The fertile lands of the town of Zator, along with the surrounding lands of our duchy are great for farming and produce excellent crops. Our people will never be hungry with the land quality that we have. During war, we will have a good supply of food to stop our people worrying about starvation."
 OSW_idea_5: "Lesser Poland Ambition"
 OSW_idea_5_desc: "Our duchy can try to expand into Lesser Poland, and maybe even compete for the Polish crown. We just need to prepare well and wait for the right moment."
 OSW_idea_7: "Great Fire of 1863"
 OSW_idea_7_desc: "The great fire of Oswiecim burnt down a church, along with two synagogues. After this fire, the local population worked very hard together and rebuilt the town, thus improving the understanding between the rich and the poor."	
 #Racibórz
 RCB_idea_1_desc: "Racibórz is the main route that connects Bohemia and Moravia with Poland, the Baltics and the Rus. The defence of our capital is of vital importance as it is a gateway for the powers of central Europe, and our allies and foes."
 RCB_idea_2_desc: "Our capital is of vital importance to the Silesian culture. It was here that the music for 'Gaude Mater Polonia' was written, the unofficial anthem of our duchy and later the Kingdom of Poland. Our steadily developing duchy has many skillful advisors who compete with each other to join our small, but powerful court."
 RCB_idea_3_desc: "The Racibórz markets which started in the 1300s made our duchy very rich and we now have much influence over trade in our region. These markets were the largest in Silesia and goods traded included salt and wheat. Our industry flourished because of this."
 RCB_idea_5_desc: "During the age of Reformation and after, Racibórz was a very Catholic city. Even though the number of Germans in Silesia grew, Racibórz welcomed King Jan Sobieski on his way to Vienna very humbly as they viewed him as a protector of the faith."
 RCB_idea_6_desc: "As Racibórz was in the Kingdom of Prussia, it experienced huge economic growth; in particular its metal industry benefited. By the 1800s, the population of the city reached 35,000."
 RCB_idea_7_desc: "The Berlin-Vienna Railway expansion of 1846 was very beneficial for Racibórz. The local garrisons could move quickly between cities and receive supply efficiently."
 #Legnica
 LNN_idea_1_desc: "In 1149 Legnica received, under Magdeburg Law its city rights and the city grew and flourished rapidly. We can build buildings cheaper as the workforce grows and our pride in our buildings grows."
 LNN_idea_2_desc: "Legnica is a nodal point. Trade routes from Poznan, Kraków, Vienna, Berlin and Wroclaw run through our capital. We control a nice portion of Silesian trade and we can efficiently embargo anyone who messes with us."
 LNN_idea_3_desc: "As the Thirty Years' War sparked off, Legnica remained neutral. Duke Jerzy Rudolf declared full isolation from the war and denied military access to both Catholic and Protestant sides. However, under large pressure, in 1634 there was a battle within the Duchy between the Swedish and Habsburg armies."
 LNN_idea_4: "Development Before War"
 LNN_idea_6_desc: "With the inclusion of Legnica into Prussia, it became the capital of the Regierungsbezirk Niederschlesien. Silesia had much autonomy and as German settlers arrived, so did pressure to build more housing. Legnica started to expand its mining industry and farming in the countryside."
 LNN_idea_7_desc: "We cannot let our neighbours bully our duchy. We need to expand our diplomacy in order to secure relations with some powerful states. In 1806 Legnica wanted to surrender to Russian forces, but nobody was brave enough to inform them about their surrender."
 #Abbasids
 BGH_idea_1_desc: "The Abbasid Caliph Al-Mansur commissioned the city of Baghdad in 762. It was built to become one of the most magnificent cities in the world, as the capital of the Abbasid Empire."
 BGH_idea_4_desc: "Abu Hanifa described Dar al-Islam as a country tolerant of, ruled by, and bordering Muslims. We satisfy these conditions; thus, we are Dar al-Islam."
 BGH_idea_7_desc: "Over the centuries, the Abbasids gradually lost control of their far-flung territories, eventually controlling only the city of Baghdad and neighboring Mesopotamia. We shall restore the rule and glory of the Abbasids by reconquest."
 #Seljuks
 SJK_idea_1_desc: "The Seljuks, like many other hordes, used a variety of intimidation tactics as an attempt to compel the enemy army to surrender without a fight. Our use of these tactics will help our country expand."
 SJK_idea_2_desc: "The Byzantines, under Romanos IV in 1071, disastrously tried to violate our truce and reconquer Anatolia while the Sultan Alp Arslan was dealing with a Fatimid threat. We shall defeat them for once and for all."
 SJK_idea_3_desc: "The Seljuks under Alp Arslan implemented hit and run tactics, and alongside the mobility of the cavalry, made the Seljuks a very mobile and deadly force."
 SJK_idea_6_desc: "While the Seljuks are stereotypically associated as a horde, some of its sultans, including Malik-Shah I, embraced the arts and literature."
 #Qahira
 fatimid_idea_1_desc: "The Fatimids were ruled by a Shia dynasty, and most of the ruling class was Shia as well. It became a contrast to the Sunni Abbasid dynasty, which held the position of Caliph."
 fatimid_idea_5_desc: "As the Fatimids expanded, so did their center of power. Their capital city transitioned several times as well. Cairo was planned in 970 and continued to be the largest city of Egypt for centuries."
 fatimid_idea_7_desc: "Relatively uncommon at the time was the appointment of government officials based on merit, not from family connections."
 #Berry
 BER_idea_4_desc: "The Coeur,or 'Heart', family fittingly had close connections with the city of Bourges in the heart of France. Jacques Coeur was a rich merchant involved in Levantine trade who built a monumental palace in the city and had his son Jean installed as Archbishop."
 BER_idea_5_desc: "The greatest and most long-lived specimen of French Gothic manuscript illumination is a fifteenth century text called 'Les Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry', a Book of Hours commissioned by Jean de Valois."
 #Jalayirids
 JYA_idea_6_desc: "While some states find themselves anchored to a particular city, the Jalayirid Sultanate variously had its capital at Baghdad, Tabriz, Soltaniyeh, and Basra, sometimes with multiple rulers reigning simultaneously in different regions. This lent the Sultanate a dynamism that let it withstand outside pressures."
 #Avaria
 AVR_idea_7_desc: "When the imperialist Russians sought to bring Dagestan under their control and impose a false religion on the Avar people, local Imams banded together to form a state that could resist them. The Imamate held off the far-superior Russian army for over thirty years."
 #Dulkadir
 DUL_idea_5_desc: "Our nation has so many mountains and highlands we can use for defence, making our foes think twice before attacking us. If we can embrace the basics of guerrilla warfare, we can defend our nation even more efficient."
 DUL_idea_7_desc: "Even though we are ready to defend our nation by any means necessary, an attack from a regional power would cost many of our own lives. So before declaring war on someone and taking sides, we can try embracing a balance policy and make ourselves loved by everyone."
 #Eretna
 ERE_idea_2_desc: "When our governor ran away and left these lands, Mongols wanted us to submit to their rule. But we refused and when they tried to invade us, we defeated them and pushed them from our lands. This victory surely will make other states respect us."
 ERE_idea_3_desc: "Even though we took our lands rightfully, we still had some enemies. Timurbaş's son claimed that he was the governor of Anatolia and tried to take over our lands. However we defeated them and showed who is the rightful ruler of these lands. Eretna Bey claimed himself 'Ala ad-Din' after this battle and became the undisputed ruler of Eretna."
 ERE_idea_4_desc: "The Mongols treated the people of Anatolia really harshly and made them suffer, so they wanted a new leadership. If we treat our people kinder than they did we can show what good leadership is and prevent any possible rebellions threatening our future."
 ERE_idea_5_desc: "Our nation started with quite a big land, and governing this may cause some trouble to us. Even though we don't want to admit it, we must govern our nation by giving governors more power and let them govern our cities."
 ERE_idea_6_desc: "Religion is so important for our state. We celebrate with praising and we become more powerful with our sheiks. Considering these lands once belonged to infidels, it is time to show our people what is the true faith and how to live according to Islam."
 ERE_idea_7: "Mountains of the East"
 #Germiyan
 GRM_idea_1_desc: "While the other beyliks strove for their own identity quickly, a part of the Seljuk tradition lives on in our nation. We can thus learn the military tactics of our former overlords very well."
 GRM_idea_6: "Patron of Literature"
 GRM_idea_6_desc: "Some important Turkish poets came from Germiyan, among them Seyhi. After his studies in Persia, he became the best-known author of his time and wrote an everlasting satirical masterpiece of literary history, his 'Donkey Book'."
 GRM_idea_7_desc: "To regain the territories lost to the Ottomans, Bey Yakup II allied with the Timurids. The Ottomans were defeated in the Battle of Ankara in 1402 so that Germiyan was given their former territories as a reward for our performance in the battle by Timur."
 #Ganja
 GNJ_idea_5_desc: "Unlike the undeveloped surrounding lands in Azerbaijan, Ganja is home to many impressive stone structures, like the Chokak Bath, Ganja Fortress, and Alexander Nevsky church."
 GNJ_idea_6_desc: "Ganja was closely aligned with the Safavid Empire in Persia and its successors, eventually becoming an independent Khanate when the Empire disintegrated. Its autonomous Khans needed to maintain order in the region while the rest of Iran was in chaos, whether through military police or bloodhounds."
 #Iraq
 IRQ_idea_6_desc: "When the Abbasids ruled over their Empire from Baghdad, Iraq became an important center of the Muslim religion, whereas the arts and sciences were promoted more than in any other region of the world. Let us start a second Golden Age."
 IRQ_idea_7_desc: "Iraq has been part of other realms for a long time, including the Abbasid, Mongolian, Persian, Ottoman and Mamluk Empires, under which our people and country have suffered. We must prevent this from happening again and preserve our independence by forming strong alliances."
 #Great Horde
 GOL_idea_1: "Heir of the Mongol Empire"
 GOL_idea_1_desc: "The Golden Horde is one of the successor states to Genghis Khan's empire. We were ruling a big chunk of land and we were unstoppable. However, after many years our power is declining and we have become a weak state. But now it's time to claim what is rightfully ours and we won't be afraid of battling our foes by doing so. To arms!"
 GOL_idea_2_desc: "Even if we believe in Islam now, our ancestors had different beliefs such as Tengrism or Buddhism. We can't throw our culture away, else can we really call ourselves a state? We must tolerate our former religions if we really want to call ourselves a nation with history."
 GOL_idea_3_desc: "The Kipchaks are an important part of our nation, and they sure know how to ride a horse because of their culture. In a state of war, we can make them fight for us and recruit with less money."
 GOL_idea_4_desc: "Russian lands were always a sweet target for us, and we were able to control these lands for a while, even though we don't want to accept that we are not in a golden age. So in 1480, we chose to leave the Russians alone instead of fighting. The Russians knew that if we tried to defeat them, we could. So our mercy to them will benefit us on the diplomatic stage."
 GOL_idea_6: "A Sedentary Horde"
 GOL_idea_6_desc: "A lot of nations around us think that we are some barbaric state which just raids nations. But it is not true. We adopted a sedentary culture and founded our own cities, such as Sarai. We know how to found and improve a city and we couldn't need that knowledge more right now as we don't have much land."
 GOL_idea_7: "Tributary System"
 GOL_idea_7_desc: "We don't always want to conquer, instead we may need money for our nation. So our ancestors found a great way to gain some money for our nation: they made other nations pay for us. That way we became prosperous. We can adopt their system and try to force our vassals to give more money to us."
 #Volga Bulgaria
 VGB_idea_2_desc: "Not only through the foundation of cities and caravansaries we have become a true trading empire, but also through our favourable location on the Volga River. Today we are an important bridge for long-distance trade between Russian and Oriental merchants."
 VGB_idea_3_desc: "With the help of oriental architects and lush trading incomes, we are able to found new cities and rebuild and expand existing ones. Among them, there are Bolgar, Bilär, Suwar, Kashan, Juketau, Oshel, Tukhchin, Bryakhimov and Taw Ile, all featuring fortresses, mosques and caravansaries."
 #Antioch
 ATC_idea_1_desc: "We came to these lands to spread the one and only true faith to these Saracens. Every human deserves to have a chance to follow the faith and we will make sure they will use their chance."
 ATC_idea_2: "Knights Hospitaller"
 ATC_idea_2_desc: "Founded in 1099, the Knights Hospitaller supported their brothers in arms with both building hospitals for them and supporting them in their fights. Now, we have their support and their services will affect us greatly."
 ATC_idea_3_desc: "Founded to protect the Church of The Holy Sepulchre, the Canons of The Holy Sepulchre helped us and the other crusaders in our holy wars. Their knowledge and discipline are widely known in the world, and their help to us will make our infantry force stronger."
 ATC_idea_6_desc: "There are so many Saracens who desire our lands and they will not stop until they finally take them. We are not afraid of death, but we can't defend these lands by ourselves for long. So we must seek protection from other faithful nations by improving our relations with them."
 ATC_idea_7: "Cultural Environment"
 ATC_idea_7_desc: "We just want to spread the true faith in these lands; any human being who believes Christianity is welcome in our lands, no matter his or her race. In the Eastern World, many people of different cultures coexist and we must respect every culture."
 #Cuman-Kipchak
 CMN_idea_3_desc: "Since the 10th century, the tribes of the Cumans and the Kipchak have formed a tribal confederation that extends from the Danube to the Irtysh. This alliance has made the two tribes the dominant power in the Eurasian steppe for a long time, often terrorizing nearby nations."
 CMN_idea_6_desc: "Boniak the Mangy is truly one of the most famous Cuman chiefs of all time. With his entourage, he invaded the Kievan Rus to plunder cities and monasteries and even burn down the palace of the Kievan prince in Berestove, thereby becoming the terror of the Rus. Later he obtained a spectacular victory against an army of the Hungarian king, confiscating royal treasures as a result."
 #Ankara
 AHI_idea_1_desc: "The Westerners usually see us as barbarians thinking we are uncivilized people and not hesitating to justify their crusades against us by using this. But by giving our people the right to vote, we can show every nation that we are as civilized as they are and make our nation be heard by the whole world."
 AHI_idea_3_desc: "We have a strict rule if you want to join our brotherhood: You have to be a Muslim. We do not need any people who believe in wrong faiths. That way, our brotherhood stays holy and pure. For the blessing of Allah!"
 AHI_idea_4_desc: "Many Turks have adopted the settled life and claimed many lands like Anatolia. But Anatolia is not fully Turkish. We must help our nomadic brothers adopt the settled life and make Anatolia a Turkish land once and for all."
 AHI_idea_7_desc: "There are a lot of members of our brotherhood in other beyliks, even among the Seljuks and Ottomans. Even the first Ottoman Padishahs are a member of our brotherhood. This helps us spread our influence to other nations and make them our friends."
 #Kahzars
 KHZ_idea_3_desc: "A testament to the Jewish identity of the Khazar nobility comes in the form of correspondences between Hasdai ben Shaprut, the Jewish foreign secretary of the Caliph of Cordoba, and Joseph ben Aaron, Khan of Khazaria. In the letter Joseph explains how the Khazars converted to Judaism in the eighth century and how they maintain Jewish worship in their state."
 KHZ_idea_5_desc: "To maintain the power of the Khazar elites over the Oghuz and Alan masses, aristocrats relied on a corps of elite Khwarezmian mercenary guards called Ursiyya. The Ursiyya were the backbone of the Khazar army and deeply influential in the government, like later Mamluks or Janissaries."
 #Armenia
 armenian_ducal_idea_1_desc: "Tiridates III's conversion to Christianity in the fourth century after a miraculous cure made him the first monarchy in the entire world to accept Christianity as a state religion. While later converted states took different directions in what they considered orthodoxy, Armenia stuck to its maverick ways by rejecting the Council of Chalcedon and thus establishing an autonomous Oriental church."
 armenian_ducal_idea_7_desc: "'Veratsnund' is the Armenian word for Revival, signifying the Armenian National Revival that occurred in the Ottoman Empire after the Tanzimat reforms. Armenian language, culture, and literature experienced a Renaissance while agitators pushed for a united Armenian state."
 #Blois
 XBL_idea_6_desc: "With the coronation of Theobald I in 1234, the Kingdom of Navarra came under the control of the House of Blois, which would rule it for fifty years. The French kings of Navarra brought the kingdom an unprecedented economic boom and always maintained good relations with the French king."
 #Syria
 SYR_idea_7_desc: "Syria is located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, but does not play any significant role there, although our ports are important for Mediterranean trade. We must aim to utilise our favourable location on important trade routes to become a trading power on the water as well."
 #Cappadocia
 CPP_idea_1_desc: "After the invasion of the Isaurians in the 4th century, the Huns in the 5th century and finally Persian groups in the 6th century, the latter conquering Caesarea in 605, the intensive construction of both underground and above ground cave structures and entire cities began. The buildings were mainly built for security and defense aspects. After 642, when Arabs began to invade the region, these aspects became increasingly important, so that for three centuries Christian communities lived here in hiding and protected against attackers. Under the following period of Byzantine rule, Christianity and with it Christian architecture flourished in Cappadocia. Until the 11th century, about 3000 churches were hewn out of the stone."
 CPP_idea_3_desc: "The so-called Love Valley is a hidden valley situated on a high plateau of Cappadocia, full of strange rock formations near Korama. Some believe that these stone structures look like the male genitals."
 CPP_idea_7_desc: "Cappadocia shared an always-changing relationship with neighbouring Armenia, by that time a region of the Empire. The Arab historian Abu Al Faraj asserts the following about Armenian settlers in Sivas, during the 10th century: 'Sivas, in Cappadocia, was dominated by the Armenians and their numbers became so many that they became vital members of the imperial armies. These Armenians were used as watch-posts in strong fortresses, taken from the Arabs. They distinguished themselves as experienced infantry soldiers in the imperial army and were constantly fighting with outstanding courage and success by the side of the Romans, in other words, Byzantines.'"
 #Isauria
 ISU_idea_1_desc: "In ancient times, the Isaurians were feared as robbers, pirates, slave traders and warriors, who made careers as soldiers in the Byzantine army from the late 5th century onwards and were used by Emperor Leo I as a counterweight to the Gothic troops."
 ISU_idea_6_desc: "Lake Tatta is a large lake in the middle of Anatolia; it does not contain freshwater but saltwater. It allows us to mine large salt deposits, which will help us to achieve great wealth."
 #Buyids
 BGH_idea_1_desc: "We have come up with a military tax collection system that will greatly increase our wealth. The Iqta will pay for our armies and be a major source of funds and revenue."
 BGH_idea_5_desc: "We have our roots as Zoroastrian Daylamites and claim to be descendants of Bahram V, a Sassanid Shahanshah. May our noble family increase our wealth and diplomatic standing."
 #Neuchatel
 NCH_idea_4_desc: "Neuchâtel was historically one of the Protestant strongholds in Switzerland. May we not be influenced by heretics!"

 VLW_idea_6: "Jeanne d'Arc"
 VLW_idea_6_desc: "After the disastrous Battle of Agincourt, French forces were badly in need of a major victory. It was thought that had the English captured the important city of Orléans, they would be the next to control the French Crown. Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl, claimed to be able to lead the French to victory. Sure enough, just nine days after she showed up to Orléans, the siege was over and the French were the victors."
 #Kyburg
 FBO_idea_2: "Strategic Marriages"
 FBO_idea_2_desc: "The Kyburgs expanded their realm at the expense of other dynasties. They acquired Lenzburg, Windegg, See-Gaster, Fribourg, Thun, Burgdorf, and other territories in Burgundy and west of the Rhine."
 FBO_idea_3_desc: "The lands ruled by the Kyburgs were amongst the most fertile in all of Switzerland. We shall use our blessed geography to our advantage."
 FBO_idea_6_desc: "Many vassals of the Kyburgs became ministeriales and went into service for the family."
 #Habsburg

 HABS_idea_3_desc: "By planning our marriages strategically, we have the potential to grow in wealth and power."
 HABS_idea_4_desc: "Through marriages, the Habsburgs were able to expand their influence and came to rule over vast lands including Austria, Spain, Burgundy, the Netherlands, Bohemia, Hungary, Milan, and others."
 HABS_idea_5_desc: "In 1415, the Swiss Confederacy was able to push the Habsburgs out of Switzerland, our ancestral home. We shall learn our lessons."
 HABS_idea_7_desc: "Even after the Protestant Reformation, the Habsburgs remained strongly Catholic. The Habsburgs became the most influential Catholics of their day apart from the Pope."
 #Marrakesh
 MRK_idea_6_desc: "After the fall of the Almohads, their old Mahdist religious doctrines lingered in Marrakesh. Only through the construction of new mosques could the Marinids get the heresy under control."
 #Fez
 FEZ_idea_4_desc: "The favourable location of Fez at the crossroads of important trade routes played a decisive role in the rapid development of the new town. Of particular importance were the caravan routes between the Atlantic and the Maghreb as well as the Mediterranean and Sub-Saharan Africa via the great trading city of Sijilmassa in Tafilalt."
 FEZ_idea_6_desc: "The dye production in Fez came to hold such influence that the fez, or Tarboosh, a typical oriental headgear, was named after the city. Initially popular among Balkan peoples, the Ottoman sultans also began to grow fond of this hat."
 #Kartli
 KTI_idea_3_desc: "Tbilisi, our most important city is one of the most famous cities in the country, if not in entire Georgia. Hundreds of people visit the city every day and a lot of merchants are coming to trade. By holding this prosperous city, our nation will become renowned and it will make other nations hear about us."
 #Orkney
 ORK_idea_3_desc: "Orkney is an 'Earldom' not because it originated with an Anglo-Saxon earl but because it was first entrusted to local Norwegian jarls, a line of Norse chieftains with sweeping autonomy from the Norwegian state. We must preserve this tradition of autonomy and confirm our status as jarls."
 ORK_idea_4_desc: "Due to our status as an island nation, connected to the other archipelagos to our north such as Shetland and Faroe, we rely on the sea in all aspects of life. We fish, whale, and maintain a strong navy to facilitate travel around the realm and defend from the Scots and Scandinavians."
 #Cilicia
 CLC_idea_5: "Legitimized by the Emperor"
 CLC_idea_6_desc: "It was not the Byzantine Empire who was able to defeat our Muslim enemies. It was the foreign Franks who could drive the infidels out of the Levant. We should learn from Frankish warfare to improve our army tactics."
