 vn_fri_church_of_frisians_title: "Church of the Frisians"
 vn_fri_church_of_frisians_desc: "The Church of the Frisians in Rome is the closest church to the Saint Peter's Basilica, serving a colony of Frisians that have been living in Rome as early as the 8th century. Recent wars however have left the church in bad condition. As devout Christians we should help to restore the church and improve our relation with the Holy See."
 vn_fri_land_of_monasteries_title: "Land of Monasteries"
 vn_fri_land_of_monasteries_desc: "Frisians are known as devout followers of Christ's rule. It should therefore come as no surprise that no region in the Lowlands is shaped by monasteries as much as Frisia. The oldest monasteries emerged in the 9th century as chapters of Augustinians. Later, most of the monasteries were of the order of the Benedictines, Cistercians, Premonstratensians and Franciscans."
 vn_fri_legacy_of_menno_simons_title: "Legacy of Menno Simons"
 vn_fri_legacy_of_menno_simons_desc: "The Reformation didn't go by unnoticed in Frisia. Our lands gave rise to Protestant reformers such as Menno Simons and Obbe Philips. Since then, Frisia largely abandoned Catholicism and instead embraced various Protestant denominations such as Anabaptism, Calvinism and Lutheranism. Both West Frisia and East Frisia are viewed as societies with a high degree of religious tolerance. We should uphold this ideal of religious tolerance."

 vn_fri_revalue_lex_frisionum_title: "Revalue Lex Frisionum"
 vn_fri_revalue_lex_frisionum_desc: "The Lex Frisionum is an early medieval record of the customary law of our people. This recording was done by order of Charlemagne. We should uphold and revalue this Frisian law code."
 vn_fri_keuren_landrechten_title: "Keuren and Landrechten"
 vn_fri_keuren_landrechten_desc: "The 17 Keuren and 24 Landrechten are a collection of texts in which parts of the law and freedoms of Frisia are recorded. The rationale for the written recording of the 17 Keuren and 24 Landrechten lies in the need to make the Frisian privileges known widely, when the royal officials, the counts, are beginning to act as sovereign landlords, thereby threatening our rights."
 vn_fri_upstalsboom_league_title: "Upstalsboom League"
 vn_fri_upstalsboom_league_desc: "Although our lands have long been characterized by the ideals of the Frisian Freedom, this freedom is increasingly being threatened by foreign princes and domestic feuds. In order to provide a more systematic legal system, local leaders should agree and apply rules to all of Frisia. Delegations from all gaue should be sent to annual meetings at the Upstalsboom in Aurich, to judge, to make decisions and, if necessary, to defend our blood-fought autonomy. The delegates should be elected in their home gau at Easter. The meetings can then take place on the Tuesday after Pentecost."
 vn_fri_upstalsboom_league.tt: "If we are a §MPeasant Republic§!:"
 vn_fri_upstalsboom_league.tt2: "If we are a §MRepublic§! but not a Peasant Republic:"
 vn_fri_upstalsboom_league.tt3: "If we are no §MRepublic§!:"
 vn_fri_upstalsboom_league.tt4: "We will gain a casus belli against all monarchies and theocracies of the Holy Roman Empire for the next 100 years to change their government to ours."
 vn_fri_drenther_crusade_title: "Drenther Crusade"
 vn_fri_drenther_crusade_desc: "The Bishop of Utrecht has trouble maintaining his sovereignty over the peasants of Drenthe. To make matters worse, the Drenthers have chosen the path of heresy with occult religious practices. With the approval of the Papacy we should assist the Bishop and go on a crusade against these heretics. Perhaps we are better able to contain these peasants."
 vn_fri_redbads_legacy_title: "Redbad's Legacy"
 vn_fri_redbads_legacy_desc: "Redbad was the king of Frisia from 680 until his death in 719. He managed to defeat Charles Martel at Cologne, and he is considered to be the greatest king Frisia has ever had, ruling over a kingdom that stretched from the Zwin to the river Weser. We are the proud descendants of this once legendary king. We should restore his legacy and reestablish Frisia as a great power again, respected in the whole of Europe and beyond."
 vn_fri_confirm_karelsprivilege_title: "Confirm the Karelsprivilege"
 vn_fri_confirm_karelsprivilege_desc: "The Karelsprivilege is a privilege that Charlemagne has bestowed on us in gratitude for the support we gave in the capture of Rome. The privilege is the basis of the Frisian Freedom. We are not ruled by a foreign count or duke, but we rule ourselves. We should remind the Holy Roman Emperor of this privilege."
 vn_fri_confirm_karelsprivilege.tt: "If we are part of the §MHoly Roman Empire§!:"
 vn_fri_confirm_karelsprivilege.tt2: "If we are NOT part of the §MHoly Roman Empire§!:"
 vn_fri_unify_middle_frisia_title: "Unify Middle Frisia"
 vn_fri_unify_middle_frisia_desc: "Known as Middle Frisia, the area between the Vlie and the river Ems, from Westergo to Oldambt, used to be the political centre of the medieval Frisian realm. We should unite the Frisians living in this part of Frisia."
 vn_fri_frisian_freedom_title: "Eala Frya Fresena!"
 vn_fri_frisian_freedom_desc: "All of Frisia, from the Vlie to the Weser, must be united to prevent any foreign prince claiming any of the Frisian lands as his own, threatening the freedoms our people have long enjoyed and continue to enjoy. We Frisians only owe our allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor."
 vn_fri_subjugate_groningen_title: "Subjugate Groningen"
 vn_fri_subjugate_groningen_desc: "Originally a small Saxon village, the city of Groningen has become an important trade centre in the last few centuries. Although legally under the authority of the Bishop of Utrecht, the city defied his rule and started acting like a free imperial city, although not formally recognized by the Emperor. Groningen has now turned its eyes on our lands, greatly increasing their influence in the Ommelanden, presenting itself as a Frisian city and as a defender of the Frisian Freedom! If they want to be a Frisian city so badly, we should formally integrate them in our nation."
 vn_fri_reclaim_west_frisia_title: "Reclaim West Frisia"
 vn_fri_reclaim_west_frisia_desc: "The county of Holland used to be called West Frisia, a reminder that these lands once belonged to the Frisian realm. The abandonment of their Frisian roots was completed by adopting the language of Low Franconian. Only in the north, Westflinge, Frisians hold on to their language, leading to countless attempts to subdue them to the rule of the count. Since then the counts of Holland have been a threat to our sovereignty. It is time to remind them of their roots and call these lands West Frisia again!"
 vn_fri_reconquer_trecht_title: "Reconquer Trecht"
 vn_fri_reconquer_trecht_desc: "The center of power of the early medieval Frisian kingdom was the city of Trecht, later renamed to Utrecht. Trecht was founded by the Romans as Traiectum. Later, Trecht became a matter of dispute between the Franks and the Frisians. Trecht is strategically located, giving control of important trade routes on the Rhine to the North Sea. Nowadays, Utrecht is the seat of the Bishop of Utrecht. It is time to once again claim our natural capital and restore Utrecht to its former glory."
 vn_fri_unite_the_lowlands_title: "Unite the Lowlands"
 vn_fri_unite_the_lowlands_desc: "The Frisians once settled along the Dutch coast, their seafaring legacy shaping the Lowlands. Though today's inhabitants may not call themselves Frisians, we share a common heritage of trade and resilience. By uniting these lands under our banner, we will strengthen our grip on the North Sea and create the foundation for a mighty nation."
 vn_fri_unify_east_frisia_title: "Unify East Frisia"
 vn_fri_unify_east_frisia_desc: "Between the rivers Ems and Weser lie the lands of the East Frisians, known for, among other things, hosting the annual Upstalsboom gatherings. Our people even colonized a strip of land on the other side of the Weser, known as Wursten. We should unite the Frisians living in this part of Frisia."
 vn_fri_develop_emden_title: "Develop Emden"
 vn_fri_develop_emden_desc: "Emden was founded in around 800 as a small trading settlement on a mound on the Ems, connecting it to upstream towns and cities. Emden has great potential to become an important port, connecting Frisia to the trade routes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, enabling our merchants and skippers to once again play an important role in international trade."
 vn_fri_develop_wetlands_title: "Develop the Wetlands"
 vn_fri_develop_wetlands_desc: "The North Sea has been our greatest friend and our most feared enemy at the same time. Although she gave us easy access to foreign markets, the sea has flooded our lands countless times, resulting in the drowning of tens of thousands of people and catastrophic material damage. We should build dykes to protect the coastal areas, giving us a chance to increase agricultural production in the many fertile coastal lands Frisia offers."
 vn_fri_develop_wetlands.tt: "Every owned province with §YMarsh§! terrain will gain the following:"
 vn_fri_liberate_north_frisia_title: "Liberate North Frisia"
 vn_fri_liberate_north_frisia_desc: "Centuries ago, Frisians settled on Helgoland and the islands of the Uthlande. More recently, the coastal marshlands of the mainland were also colonized. By establishing trade relations with East Anglia and controlling the salt trade, the North Frisians grew prosperous. Nowadays however, Danish kings try to claim sovereignty over the North Frisians. We should come to the aid of our brothers in the North and reunite them with the rest of Frisia. No Frisian should be subjected to foreign rule!"
 vn_fri_liberate_north_frisia.tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on all coastal provinces in §YAgder§! and §YHördaland§!."
 vn_fri_north_sea_whaling_title: "North Sea Whaling"
 vn_fri_north_sea_whaling_desc: "With the onset of whaling, the people from the Uthlande in North Frisia have developed a reputation of being very skilled mariners, and most Dutch and English whaling ships bound for Greenland and Svalbard have a crew of North Frisian islanders. On the island of Feer alone, roughly a quarter of the inhabitants are whalers. North Frisian seamen continue to serve foreign whaling companies. Maybe we should set up a whaling company as well so that they can serve Frisian interests."
 vn_fri_north_sea_whaling.tt: "If we complete this mission while being §MProduction Leader§! in Fish or Whales:"
 MONOPOLY_INCOME_FISH_WHALES_DESC: "from fish and whales production."
 vn_fri_rebuild_dorestad_title: "Rebuild Dorestad"
 vn_fri_rebuild_dorestad_desc: "Dorestad was an early medieval emporium in the early medieval kingdom of Frisia. It flourished during the 8th to early 9th centuries as one of the most important trading posts in Northwestern Europe, due to its proximity to the fork in the Rhine, with easy access to all surrounding areas. Persistent Viking raids and the decline of international trade in favor of regional trade led to the downfall of Dorestad as an important trading hub. With Dorestad once again in Frisian hands and with the growing importance of international trade we should restore this town to its former glory."
 vn_fri_found_rustringen_title: "Found Rüstringen"
 vn_fri_found_rustringen_desc: "Lying at the mouth of the river Weser, the gau of Rüstringen is often subject to devastating floods, resulting in the creation of the Jadebusen. We should organize the construction of dikes, paving the way for the foundation of the city of Rüstringen. This will give us an opportunity to control the trade with the upstream city of Bremen and it will also strengthen our position as a naval power."
 vn_fri_mare_frisicum_title: "Mare Frisicum"
 vn_fri_mare_frisicum.tt: "No country in the §YNorth Germany§!, §YScandinavia§!, §YLowlands§! or §YBritain§! Superregion has a navy larger than ours."
 vn_fri_mare_frisicum_desc: "The North Sea was once called 'Mare Frisicum'. This name reminds us of the Early Middle Ages, a period which was marked by the rule of, among others, the legendary king Redbad, and in which Frisian merchants maintained and ruled an extensive network of important Northern European trade routes. These trade routes even went as far as Sigtuna and Novgorod. We should do everything we can to restore our position as a maritime power and reestablish Mare Frisicum."
 vn_fri_colonize_peatlands_title: "Colonize the Peatlands"
 vn_fri_colonize_peatlands_desc: "The peatlands have long remained inhospitable areas, leaving them mostly uninhabited until now. Recent technological improvements, however, have enabled us to settle in these lands. The peatlands have a valuable thing to offer: peat, a great source of fuel and a valued product in the ever growing cities of Frisia. We should set up colonies where workers can excavate the peatlands for peat production."

 vn_flavor_fri.100.t: "Restore the Old Capital?"
 vn_flavor_fri.100.d: "The centers of power of the early medieval Frisian kingdom were the city of Trecht, nowadays the seat of the Bishop of Utrecht, and the now perished city of Dorestad, once one of the most important trading hubs in northwestern Europe. With both cities back in Frisian hands, it is time for us to decide if we should relocate our center of power back to one of these cities."
 vn_flavor_fri.100.a: "Trecht should be our new capital!"
 vn_flavor_fri.100.b: "Or how about Dorestad?"
 vn_flavor_fri.100.c: "Actually, [Root.Capital.GetName] is fine."
 vn_flavor_fri.101.t: "The Legend of Akraberg"
 vn_flavor_fri.101.d: "Now that we have a greater presence in the lands surrounding the North Sea, many foreign legends and folk tales reach our shores. According to one of these legends there exists a colony of Frisians on the southern tip of the distant Faroese island of Suðuroy.\nThe legend says a group of Frisians left their homeland when it was conquered by Charles Martel in 734. With dragon boats they became pirates just like the Danes and captured many loads in the seaports of the Baltic. One day the fleet was dispersed by a storm and one of the ships landed on Suðuroy. Here the Frisians were given the southern edge of the island, where they founded the colony of Akraberg. It is said that they remained heathens a long time after the rest of the Faroe Islands were Christianized."
 vn_flavor_fri.101.a: "We must reunite these long lost compatriots with the homeland!"
 vn_flavor_fri.102.t: "The Frisian Freedom"
 vn_flavor_fri.102.d: "Since the subjugation of the Kingdom of Frisia by the Merovingians in the 8th century, the Frisians have remained divided. But after centuries of fragmentation, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has succeeded in uniting the majority of Friesland under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] banner. Forged in resistance and a proud refusal to bow to foreign rulers, the Frisians now stand together with a common purpose. We shall call this vision the 'Frisian Freedom'.\nNow we must decide what kind of future we will build. Shall we hold fast to our rural traditions, embrace the call of the sea, or let commerce shape our destiny?"
 vn_flavor_fri.102.a: "We are primarily peasants."
