#Events
 monument_events.1.t: "The Krakow Saltworks"
 monument_events.1.d: "The development of the royal salt mines of Wieliczka and Bochnia has greatly benefited our economy. The sale of salt to surrounding states represents a significant share of our national revenues today, allowing other projects to be financed.\nNow it has been considered to intensify the domestic salt production by establishing Krakow Saltworks, to strengthen our competitiveness at the European salt market."
 monument_events.1.a: "Found the Krakow Saltworks."
 monument_events.1.b: "The salt mines already generate enough profit for us."
 monument_events.2.t: "The Artworks of [3427.GetName]"
 monument_events.2.d: "Our palaces must always be decorated with impressive artworks that demonstrate the extraordinary wealth and splendor of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. However, as the most impressive palace in the entire [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName], the Winter Palace in [3427.GetName] still lacks a proper art collection. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now considering purchasing the most valuable paintings and sculptures from the continent to exhibit them at the Winter Palace."
 monument_events.2.a: "We shall create the largest and foremost art collection in Europe."
 monument_events.2.b: "The Winter Palace is perfect as it is."
 monument_events.3.t: "The Catholicos of All Armenians"
 monument_events.3.d: "After Armenia embraced Christianity as state religion in 301 AD, the city of Etchmiadzin became the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate. Due to its spiritual importance, the city quickly became a cultural and religious center for Armenian Christianity.\nNow, with Etchmiadzin finally back in the hands of pious Armenians after centuries under foreign rule, the ancient Catholicosate was again able to leave its long exile in Cilicia and return to Etchmiadzin. We are the restorers of Armenian Christianity!"
 monument_events.3.a: "Splendid!"
 monument_events.4.t: "The Third Rome?"
 monument_events.4.d: "The city of [2135.GetName] with its majestic Tsarevets Fortress - 'the Mountain of the Tsars' - is considered the cosmopolitan center of our [Root.GovernmentName] and beyond, as all the political and religious concerns of [Root.GetName] converge here. Undoubtedly, this glorious city outshines the largest capitals in the Balkans.\nRecently, [2135.GetName] has eclipsed even the Byzantine metropolis of Constantinople; if some [Root.GetAdjective] visionaries had their way, we would now exploit this situation in our favor and claim the legacy of the Third Rome for [2135.GetName], without the Byzantines being able to object."
 monument_events.4.a: "This is a unique opportunity that we need to seize!"
 monument_events.4.b: "We do not daydream about the past."
