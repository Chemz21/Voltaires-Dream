#BURGUNDY
 vn_missions.52.t: "A New Capital?"
 vn_missions.52.d: "The city of Arles was once one of the most important cities in southern France, being the seat of the kings of Arles, a kingdom created out of a merger of the former kingdoms of Lower and Upper Burgundy in 933. However, after the death of the nominal king of Arles, Rodolph III, in 1032 without issue, the kingdom passed to the Holy Roman Emperors, and it thus ceased to play a major political role. Several duchies broke away from the kingdom, such as Provence, Dauphine and even our own duchy in Burgundy. This has led to the rapid decline in power and prestige of the city.\nHowever, with Cisjurania, Transjurania, Provence and Burgundy now under our firm control, we can once again claim to be the rightful successors of the this historic kingdom. To celebrate the reunification of these territories, we should move the capital to its rightful place."
 vn_missions.52.a: "Arles, be the shining beacon of Burgundy once more."
 vn_missions.52.b: "I still quite like [Root.Capital.GetName], if you don't mind."
 vn_missions.53.t: "Coronation at Trier"
 vn_missions.53.d: "The crowning achievement of our efforts are finally upon us as [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] coronation in Trier as the first King of Burgundy in decades. And who else should be suited for this task of coronating our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] other than the Holy Roman Emperor? The event has sent shockwaves throughout Europe and will irrevocably alter the balance of power, now that a king with territory stretching from Amsterdam to Arles has been officially recognized by an emperor. We must waste no time in reaping the prestige and foreign praise this coronation has given us!"
 vn_missions.53.a: "Burgundy, resurgent once more!"
#NORMANDY
 vn_missions.54.t: "Byzantium Agrees to our Offer"
 vn_missions.54.d: "The [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle] [BYZ.Monarch.GetName] has agreed to our offer to send a large army of Norman mercenaries to [BYZ.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Being threatened on all sides by enemies, the Byzantines have utilized elite units such as the Varangian Guard, who are fiercely loyal to the [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle]. Our mercenaries have sworn loyalty to the [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle] and to protect the Empire from external forces, and in return we have been granted a lavish sum of money."
 vn_missions.54.a: "We hope they will make good use of these troops."
 vn_missions.55.t: "Normandy Requests Troops"
 vn_missions.55.d: "Tensions are brewing as the Norman [NRM.Monarch.GetTitle] [NRM.Monarch.GetName] has made clear his intention to seize the English throne by force if necessary, claiming that the late king Eadweard promised him the throne. Now, he is reaching out to other reputable dukedoms across the land requesting soldiers to fight the inevitable war to come.\nToday, a Norman diplomat arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] asking for our contribution. They claim their cause has even been sanctioned by the Pope himself, but we have yet to respond. How should we proceed, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 vn_missions.55.a: "Gladly, if your cause is just..."
 vn_missions.55.a.tt: "This action will cost us §R5,000§! Manpower."
 vn_missions.55.a.tt2: "We send a diplomat back to Normandy informing them of our response."
 vn_missions.55.b: "I am afraid we cannot send any at the moment."
 vn_missions.56.t: "[From.GetName] Sends Troops"
 vn_missions.56.d: "[From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] has agreed to support us in our righteous war to seize the English throne from unfit tyrants. A sizeable detachment is beginning to arrive in Normandy which will bolster our ranks considerably."
 vn_missions.56.a: "To battle, for Normandy!"
 vn_missions.57.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses to Send Troops"
 vn_missions.57.d: "Despite our diplomats' best efforts to coerce the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] to support us in our just war, our efforts ultimately proved fruitless. It unfortunately seems they are more involved with intrigues of their own."
 vn_missions.57.a: "You cowards are refusing to assist ME?!"
#SCOTLAND
 vn_missions.58.t: "The Education Act of [GetYear]"
 vn_missions.58.d: "The Education Act, passed by the Scottish parliament in 1496, required all landowners to send their eldest sons to school from the ages of 8 or 9 to study Latin, arts and the law. This made Scotland the first country in Europe to institute compulsory education, and would lay the groundwork for more legislation aimed towards improving the quality of education."
 vn_missions.58.a: "Great!"
 vn_missions.60.t: "Founding of the National Kirk"
 vn_missions.60.d: "The Scottish Reformation, beginning in 1560, was the process by which Scotland broke from the Catholic Church and established a new Church of its own, the Kirk, which was heavily influenced by Calvinism and Presbyterianism. By the establishment of this new Church we will be able to unify the country under a single religion and end the ongoing religious turmoil."
 vn_missions.60.a: "Found the Kirk!"
 vn_missions.60.b: "We have no need of the Kirk."
#BARCELONA
 vn_missions.62.t: "Frankish Influence Wanes"
 vn_missions.62.d: "Frankish influence beyond the Pyrenees first began with the creation of the Marca Hispanica in 795 as a defensive buffer zone against the Umayyad Caliphate, which held on to most of Iberia. In 801, the County of Barcelona was acquired and made subordinate to the Marca Hispanica, though after the death of Charlemagne the Catalan states became progressively more independent from Frankish affairs.\nA turning point in the County's history came in 985, when Muslim forces under Almanzor sacked Barcelona. The Count Borrell II sent a request for help to the king of France, Lothar III, but it was refused. Upon the accession of Hugh Capet as king of France, however, Borrell once again sent a request for aid, which was finally answered, but Hugh's nobles refused to support an expedition into Iberia. This almost definitively severed the connection between France and Barcelona.\nEven though we, alongside the other Catalan counties, have been able to act with much greater independence, the fact still remains that we are de jure vassals of the king of France. With the recent build-up of our military, however, we have finally asserted our independence from the Crown for the time being."
 vn_missions.62.a: "Barcelona shall be free!"
#ENGLALONDE
 vn_missions.63.t: "The Stone of Scone"
 vn_missions.63.d: "A cornerstone of the coronation ceremony for Scottish kings for centuries, the Stone of Scone has now fallen into our hands after it was pillaged from Scone Abbey. Our possession of this invaluable artifact will no doubt strengthen our claims to the Scottish realm and augment our prestige. Meanwhile, we can put the Stone to good use for the coronation of our own kings."
 vn_missions.63.a: "Splendid!"
#MILAN
 vn_missions.64.t: "Promotion to Duchy!"
 vn_missions.64.d: "After much consideration, the ruling Emperor $EMPERORNAME$ has agreed to elevate Milan to a duchy, but at a sizeable cost. Once we are crowned, our position in the political stage will transform from a mere local power among many into a burgeoning Italian powerhouse."
 vn_missions.64.d2: "As the current Emperor, we in theory possess a great deal of authority across swathes of Central Europe, but the lowly position of our home duchy diminishes our legitimacy to rule an empire. Thankfully, we can use our authority to invest ourselves as the Dukes of Milan without the chance of resistance from outside powers."
 vn_missions.64.a: "A handsome title indeed!"
 vn_missions.64.b: "And so we shall!"
 vn_missions.65.t: "The Swiss offer their help"
 vn_missions.65.d: "Swiss mercenaries are renowned for their prowess on the battlefield, and have been hired across Europe in countless wars. As it so happens, we have managed to secure a favorable contract with one of the Swiss states, offering a sizeable portion of highly disciplined mercenaries in exchange for some coin. In our time of great need, this could be the force to turn the tide of the ongoing war in our favor."
 vn_missions.65.a: "Fight for your new masters!"
 vn_missions.66.t: "The Lombard League Forms!"
 vn_missions.66.d: "At the behest of the city-state of Milan, a number of North Italian states have banded together in order to contest the authority of the Holy Roman Emperor in Italy. This arrangement has become known as the Lega Lombarda, or Lombard League. The Emperor has already issued an imperial ban on the participating states, but this is only seeming to fuel the fires of resistance. At any rate, the Emperor faces a serious threat if the states of Lombardy are able to band together for a common cause, as they have gained the support of the Pope himself to fight Imperial encroachment."
 vn_missions.66.a: "We shall lead the resistance!"
 vn_missions.67.t: "Lombard League Disbands"
 vn_missions.67.d: "When the Lombard League was created as a means of defending against Imperial authority in Italy, the partnership had a purpose. But now the political tides have changed, and many city-states belonging to the League are questioning its continued existence without the threat of the Empire. This has meant that the League is no longer a loose confederation as it once was, and has therefore been rendered obsolete."
 vn_missions.67.a: "It should probably stay that way."
#LORRAINE
 vn_missions.68.t: "The Capital of Lotharingia"
 vn_missions.68.d: "Now that the kingdom of Lotharingia has once again been revived, a decision must be taken as to where the nation's capital should be.\nAachen, the former political center of Charlemagne's empire, is one such candidate. In order to assert our claim to the rest of the empire he once held, we could relocate to the city.\nHowever, to appeal to our own history we could move the capital to Metz, given that it was the capital of the former Kingdom of Lotharingia.\nAlternatively, the city of Nancy, the historical seat of the dukes of Lorraine, could also be a suitable capital. Which city shall we move to?"
 vn_missions.68.a: "Aachen, the center of the Frankish Empire!"
 vn_missions.68.b: "Metz, the birthplace of the Carolingians!"
 vn_missions.68.c: "Nancy, the seat of the dukes of Lorraine!"
 vn_missions.68.e: "We will stick with [Root.Capital.GetName]."
#NITRA/SLOVAKIA
 vn_missions.69.t: "[From.GetName] Requests a Union"
 vn_missions.69.d: "Recently, the [From.GetAdjectiveCap]s have admitted themselves into the Holy Roman Empire, seemingly to protect themselves against the threat of the Magyars and Poles on both sides. But they may not be secure enough, as an ambassador has reached the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] court with a request from [From.Monarch.GetName] requesting a union of the states of [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName]. While the union appears to be beneficial to us both, it could also risk compromising our national sovereignty."
 vn_missions.69.a: "We have no choice but to accept."
 vn_missions.69.b: "Their offer is outrageous!"
 vn_missions.70.t: "Reestablishment of Great Moravia"
 vn_missions.70.d: "For centuries, Great Moravia has been a distant, long-forgotten ancestor to many West Slavic states. First known to have existed in 833, it was centered around the Morava river which gave the principality its name. Under its rulers Mojmir and Rastislav, the state expanded outwards to reach its maximum extent under Svatopluk 'the Great', which included parts of Moravia, Bohemia, Slovakia and Pannonia, and even as far as Ruthenia. Although it was once no more, now that we hold the heartlands of Great Moravia, we can claim to be their successors; a prestigious feat indeed."
 vn_missions.70.a: "Endless Glory!"
#FRANCE
 vn_missions.61.t: "The Batavian Question"
 vn_missions.61.d: "Our conquest of the Netherlands in its entirety has taken Europe by storm and shown the military superiority of the French. Now under martial law for the time being to keep control over a people who not just speak a different language, but in some cases practice a different faith to ours, the question still remains as to what to do with the Dutch institutions of government that still de jure exist.\nWe could either restore a Dutch republic or a Dutch monarchy, both of which would remain puppet states to us, or choose to continue centralized rule in the territories with an iron fist; this last option, though, is likely to provoke much resistance from the subjugated Dutch."
 vn_missions.61.a: "Create the Batavian Republic"
 vn_missions.61.b: "Create the Batavian Kingdom"
 vn_missions.61.c: "Continue ruling them from Paris"
 vn_missions.72.t: "March on Rome"
 vn_missions.72.d: "Our unstoppable march through Italy has culminated in the historic occupation of Rome, the seat of the Popes and a beacon of civilization. With the city finally in our hands, we can claim to be hegemons of the Italian peninsula, but one crucial question still remains. The city's riches and countless artifacts have not gone ignored by those in command of our armies, which by now are eager to be rewarded for their exploits.\nWe must either plunder the city and seize its wealth for ourselves, which would almost certainly provoke the ire of Catholic states, or take a harsh stance against looting; this, however, would almost certainly be a detriment to morale."
 vn_missions.72.a: "We have crossed the Rubicon, and now this great city must fall."
 vn_missions.72.b: "The city must not be sacked, God willing!"
 vn_missions.76.t: "Fate of the Holy Roman Empire"
 vn_missions.76.da: "With the ascension of [Root.GetMonarchName] as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, [Root.GetName] shall experience a new era of prosperity that will reflect on the empire as a whole which we control. The tyrannical unjust rule of the previous emperor now thrown off, the remaining states of the Empire are more than willing to come under our protection."
 vn_missions.76.db: "With the destruction of the Holy Roman Empire, its former legacy of creating confusing borders has been consigned to a footnote in history as we herald a new era of prosperity. Having overcome the major obstacle to [Root.GetAdjective] expansion, we are now more able than ever to move our armies further east and claim more land for the glorious [FRA.GetName]."
 vn_missions.76.a: "The Holy Roman Empire will shine once more!"
 vn_missions.76.b: "The Holy Roman Empire is no more!"
#NORWAY
 vn_missions.74.t: "Varangian Guard"
 vn_missions.74.d: "The Varangian Guard were honed warriors hailing from Northern Europe, especially Norsemen from Scandinavia, who served the Byzantine Emperor as personal bodyguards. Known for being ruthless and reliable, our political situation as of late has demanded more of these men to defend the Empire against outside threats. It happens that a [From.GetAdjective] delegation has been sent to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] offering regiments of elite huscarls in exchange for some coin. Though they fetch a handsome price, they could be especially useful in teaching our own armies more about the ways of Scandinavian tactics."
 vn_missions.74.a: "Who doesn't like a few hardy Norsemen?"
 vn_missions.74.b: "Those men can row your ships back to [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]; we don't need them."
#DENMARK
 vn_missions.51.t: "The Dannebrog"
 vn_missions.51.d: "The Dannebrog, now adopted as Denmark's national flag, has long been connected to a legend of a miraculous event that took place at the Battle of Lindanise on June 15, 1219. The Danes, who had joined the Livonian Crusade, met the forces of two Estonian tribes at Lindanise, later known as Reval. During the battle, they were surprised by the Estonians attacking their fortress from five different angles, and looked to be overwhelmed until a red flag with a white cross (the Dannebrog) fell from the sky, giving the Danes renewed hope. They then counterattacked and routed the Estonians.\nThis legend, regardless of its truth, has cemented the Dannebrog as a national icon and a source of great prestige for generations to come."
 vn_missions.51.a: "Great!"
 vn_missions.79.t: "The Kalmar Union"
 vn_missions.79.d: "The Kalmar Union was a personal union between the kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden that lasted from 1397-1523, albeit with brief interruptions. Its formation was largely a reaction to the influence of the Hanseatic League to the south. The three countries were ruled by the Danish monarch, who wanted a strong, centralized state, but this clashed with the Swedish and Norwegian nobility, who wanted to retain a degree of independence. To appease these nobles, we could delegate our conquered lands to them, or go against their wishes and continue ruling directly from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 vn_missions.79.a: "Institute the Union!"
 vn_missions.79.b: "We don't need more meddlesome subjects"
 vn_missions.79.b.tt: "Every §YNorwegian§! and §YSwedish§! core in the §YScandinavia§! superregion gets '§YDirect Rule§!' for §Y25 years§!, giving the following effects:\nLocal Unrest: §R+8§!\nLocal Autonomy: §G-0.03§!"
#DAN/NOR
 vn_missions.75.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Raid of [2268.GetCapitalName]"
 vn_missions.75.d: "In the ongoing war between [Root.GetName] and [2268.Owner.GetName], the control of one city may decide it more than any other: [2268.GetCapitalName]. Situated near the mouth of the River Thames, it has been easy prey for Viking raiders in the past. Normally the city would be well-defended, but with our naval superiority against the foe we were able to circumvent the walls and launch an amphibious attack.\nWhat followed would be carnage and destruction on a scale [2268.GetCapitalName] had never seen before. With the city now in our hands, and our coffers significantly enlarged, the tide of the war will no doubt swing in our favor; its loss has dealt a severe blow to the [2268.Owner.GetAdjective] forces still fighting against us.\nAs for [2268.GetCapitalName] itself, it will almost certainly not fully recover for quite some time. The question is how far we want to scorch the earth; perhaps the city will still be useful both economically and politically, but we will have to accept the destruction already sustained from the raid regardless."
 vn_missions.75.a: "Give no quarter and take no prisoners!"
 vn_missions.75.b: "Let [2268.GetCapitalName] be looted, but be merciful."
 vn_missions.75.c: "The city could be useful to us later; leave it be."
#PORTUGAL
 vn_missions.77.t: "Manifestis Probatum"
 vn_missions.77.d: "In the year of our Lord, [GetYear], the Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has agreed to finally recognize us as the true sovereigns of the Kingdom of Portugal. The papal bull reads as follows:\n\n...to the most beloved son in Christ, [Root.Monarch.GetName], Illustrious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Portuguese, and to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heirs, in perpetuity:\n\nIt is clearly demonstrated that, as a good son and catholic prince, you have rendered innumerable services to your mother, the Holy Church, intrepidly exterminating through hardships and military prowess the enemies of the Christian name and diligently propagating the Christian faith, thereby leaving to generations still unborn a name worthy of memory and an example deserving of imitation...\n\nWe, therefore, because of your qualities of prudence, justice and idoneity for government, take you under the protection of Saint Peter and our own, and grant and confirm by apostolic authority to your excellent domain, the Kingdom of Portugal, full honors of kingdom and the dignity that befits kings, as well as all places which, with the help of the Celestial Grace, you have wrested from the hands of the Saracens, and to which your neighboring Christian princes may not claim any rights...\n\nWith the Papacy now guaranteeing our rights to kingship, this will surely be an upset for any of our neighbors seeking to bring us back under their yoke."
 vn_missions.77.a: "Brilliant!"

 vn_missions.78.t: "Sack of [2235.GetCapitalName]"
 vn_missions.78.d: "On [GetDate], [2235.GetCapitalName] was rocked by a tragedy that has shocked the Catholic world and brought destruction to the heart of the city, which according to our recent reports was the work of disgruntled mercenaries and landsknechts allegedly under our employ.\nHaving gone without pay for some time, the mercenaries, many of whom had Reformist sentiments, marched on the heart of the Holy See and the home of Christianity. The Roman garrison had merely 5,000 defenders plus 189 of the famed Swiss Guard. Early on, any sort of organized command among the attackers broke down and they overpowered the outnumbered defense, slaughtering them and stripping the city bare of loot.\nNow with news of the atrocity spreading to courts across Europe, our reputation is in jeopardy with many seeing the attack as a way to further our expansionist ambitions."
 vn_missions.78.a: "Actually, I quite like this reputation we have!"
 vn_missions.78.b: "Use all our diplomatic efforts to soften the blow."
 vn_missions.78.c: "I'm gonna pay you 100 ducats to not speak a word of this!"
