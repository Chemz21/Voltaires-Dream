 incident_investiture_controversy.1.t: "Pressure of the Pataria"
 incident_investiture_controversy.1.d: "With the beginning of ecclesiastical reform efforts by the papacy, the Pataria, a radical clerical movement motivated by these ideas, has acquired growing influence in Lombard dioceses and monasteries. In recent weeks, they have eliminated disagreeable priests and replaced them with clerics loyal to the Pope instead.\nPressed into distress by this political opposition, Archbishop Guido of Milan has urgently decided to send the episcopal vestments back to the Emperor and retire as a monk to a secluded monastery. Before a new bishop was able to be elected, the Pataria seized the power of the bishopric and appointed a new archbishop themselves!"
 incident_investiture_controversy.1.a: "This shall not be our fight."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.t: "The Investiture Controversy"
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.d: "Starting in the late 1050s, relations between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire became incredibly strained. The main conflict was between whether the Monarch or the Pope should have the right to appoint local bishops within their demesne.\nWith the election of [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] to the Holy See, an embittered opponent of the Empire was appointed head of the Church. Influenced by religious zeal and the conviction of supremacy of the papacy, this man will try to restore the freedom of the Church in face of the Empire."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.a: "It is time to demonstrate the superiority of the Emperor."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.tt: "The Investiture Controversy can be immediately ended by the Emperor if he attains §Y75%§! warscore in a war against the Papal States using the '§YImperial Supremacy§!' casus belli.\n§RMeanwhile, the Emperor will suffer from reduced legitimacy, diplomatic reputation and papal influence.§!"
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.b: "The Pope shall be the supreme ecclesiastical head of the Empire."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.tt2: "§RThe Papal States and the Marches leave the Empire.§!\n§YThe Papal States will get claims on these areas§!."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.c: "A fair compromise must be sought."
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.t: "The Two Swords"
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.d: "In order to avert a fragmentation of the Imperial Church, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has declared all claims to spiritual supremacy of the Pope as invalid. He hopes to ward off the papal clutches over ecclesiastical matters of the Empire by doing so.\nThis is the beginning of a protracted conflict that will put Catholicism and its principles to the test."
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.d2: "Already Charlemagne knew that he needed not only the approval of his entourage but also of the Church to be legitimized as Frankish Emperor.\nIn order to prevent conflicts with the Popes, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has recognized the papacy as spiritual head of the Holy Roman Empire, which, as the representative of God, is supposed to still stand above the Emperors themselves."
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.d3: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] was able to circumvent the question of who was the legitimate spiritual head of the Holy Roman Empire by a clever compromise that granted the papacy some privileges without taking too much power away from himself. Nevertheless, these concessions will enable us to exercise our ambitions on the Empire."

 incident_investiture_controversy.6.d: "[PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has decided to excommunicate [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]! He claims the Emperor has been removed from the Church because he denies papal supremacy by continuing to appoint new bishops within the Empire. The Pope has also declared that the princes of the Empire are no longer vassals under the Emperor!\nIt has been made clear to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that to escape the damning fate of excommunication, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will have to make a humiliating trek to Canossa – the current residence of [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] – as a gesture of peace to beg for forgiveness. Should we bow to the demands of the Pope and undertake such an embarrassing escapade?"
 incident_investiture_controversy.6.a: "Let the Pope absolve our sins."

 incident_investiture_controversy.7.d: "[Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] has undertaken the arduous and dangerous journey from the imperial capital to Italy, to beg for forgiveness in front of Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Barefoot and only wearing a hair-shirt, the traditional garb of monks, [Emperor.Monarch.GetSheHe] asks for admission to the palace.\nApparently the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] regrets [Emperor.Monarch.GetHerHis] recklessness in challenging the papal authority, but it might only be a vile ruse to lift [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] excommunication."

Together they shared communion in the chapel of Saint Apollonio, officially ending the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s excommunication."
 incident_investiture_controversy.8.d2: "Although [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] remained for days outside the gates of Castle Canossa in bitter cold, he was eventually not granted an audience with [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName].

#Mediatization
 incident_mediatization.1.t: "The Question of Mediatization"
 incident_mediatization.1.d: "The Holy Roman Empire has always been much less a centralized state than it has been a conglomeration of Prince-Bishoprics, Free Cities, Principalities, Duchies and Kingdoms alike. Due to the progressive reduction of imperial authority over the preceding centuries, the Theocracies and Free Cities have more or less been allowed to thrive despite a number of conflicts with the more expansionist monarchical states, and have retained their ancient privileges dating back hundreds of years while refusing to accept integration.\n\nHowever, radical changes to the Empire's structure are on the horizon, and ones largely of our own making. As we have expanded further and further into the Empire's borders, the question of how to compensate the dispossessed secular rulers of territory we have seized has become increasingly pressing. Giving the lands back and thereby compromising ourselves would be unacceptable to us; therefore, we must convince the Emperor that secularization of all Theocracies and mediatization of all Free Cities is the only option to preserve the Empire."

 incident_mediatization.2.da: "As a Theocracy, our position in the Holy Roman Empire has been very tenuous as of late due to our conflicts with the secular states seeking to annex our lands. Our saving grace, however, has been the lavish privileges conferred on us by the Emperor in centuries past guaranteeing our rights.\nYet now, our whole territorial integrity looks to be undone with outrageous demands from [med_demander.GetName] being pushed on [emperor.GetName] to secularize all Theocracies in the Empire!"

Our saving grace, however, has been the lavish privileges conferred on us by the Emperor in centuries past guaranteeing our rights.\nYet now, our whole territorial integrity looks to be undone with outrageous demands from [med_demander.GetName] being pushed on [emperor.GetName] to mediatize all Free Cities in the Empire!"

 incident_mediatization.3.d: "The Holy Roman Empire has always been much less a centralized state than it has been a conglomeration of Prince-Bishoprics, Free Cities, Principalities, Duchies and Kingdoms alike. Due to the progressive reduction of imperial authority over the preceding centuries, the Theocracies and Free Cities have more or less been allowed to thrive despite a number of conflicts with the more expansionist monarchical states, and have retained their ancient privileges dating back hundreds of years while refusing to accept integration.\n\nHowever, radical changes appear to be on the horizon as we has failed to stop the expansionist ambitions of [med_demander.GetName], whose conquests have deprived many former secular states of their lands. Now, a [med_demander.GetAdjectiveCap] delegation has sent harsh demands to us, outrageously demanding that the Theocracies and Free Cities of the Empire be completely abolished and annexed to the dispossessed secular princes as compensation!"

 incident_mediatization.4.d: "The Holy Roman Mediatization has begun, and the worst of our fears have finally been realized as more surrounding Theocracies are dismembered and abolished by the day. The complete partition and annexation of our lands to neighboring secular states is practically a certainty, unless we choose to fight back or find some other way to convince the Emperor that we are worth saving."
