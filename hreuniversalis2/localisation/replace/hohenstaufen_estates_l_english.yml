 tribal_estate_events.6.t: "Our Kingdom is in disarray!"
 tribal_estate_events.6.d: "Keeping vassals loyal is never an easy task and right now we are living through some dire times. The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ could very likely help us stabilize the situation so that we can get back on our feet but we would be increasing their influence over our state."
 EST_VAL_TRIBES_STABILIY_BOOSTED: "Stabilized the Kingdom: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.t: "Tribes view the Kingdom as weak!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.d: "Our military leadership is inexperienced and weak. The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ are questioning if they can really support such green men in battle, offering instead to supply us with seasoned warriors ready to lead our troops."
 tribal_estate_events.7.b: "That worked oh so well for Rome."
 tribal_estate_events.8.t: "The Kingdom is not unified!"
 tribal_estate_events.8.d: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has proven [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] unable to keep the [Root.GetAdjective] realm unified and the $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ worry that we are becoming the object of ridicule. Prominent clan leaders have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] offering to strengthen our rule though some would say that relying on others to enforce this unity makes for an unstable peace."
 EST_VAL_TRIBES_UNITY: "Kingdom Unified: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 tribal_estate_events.9.t: "Adopt Tribal Methods!"
 tribal_estate_events.9.d: "One of the Clan Chiefs has come forward, as a spokesman for their group, and urges us to model our state after their old warrior societies, using the tactics that made them strong. 'Crush your enemies, drive them before you, and hear the lamentations of their women!'"
 tribal_estate_events.9.b: "That is barbarianism!"
 tribal_estate_events.11.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] after the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tribal_estate_events.11.d: "A distant cousin of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to gain the gratitude of the tribes. Many strong tribal leaders are now demanding that we change the future plans of succession to ensure that this cousin is guaranteed his rightful place as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Whether they are motivated by true loyalty to our kinsman or feel he could easily be influenced is hard to tell but they would certainly not take refusal to follow their advice very well."
 tribal_estate_events.12.t: "Tribes demand more men"
 tribal_estate_events.12.d: "Prominent Tribal leaders have approached us demanding that we let them make use of the state resources to defend their lands. They claim that neighboring states are making incursions and raids into the land they control and that the only efficient way to defend our borders is to put some of our troops directly under their command."

 desc_the_proper_old_ways: "We have attempted to change our rule according to what we imagine was the way of the ancient hordes and warrior-cultures. Some would call this backward, we call it proper."

Their great influence over local baronies as well as over many matters in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] has allowed them to prepare to break off into an entirely new state."

 estate_holy_orders_disaster: "Holy Orders' Independence"
 estate_holy_orders_disaster_desc: "The Holy Orders have grown so powerful that they have broken off to form a country of their own, outside of our control."
 estate_holy_orders: "Holy Orders"
 estate_holy_orders_desc: "The Holy Orders consist of various fraternal organizations, crusader societies, and baronies landed within Europe. The various Bailiwicks often have little communication with any Grandmaster and thus conduct their affairs through a sovereign monarch. The Holy Orders aspire to be recognized as an estate of the same importance as the Nobility and will enlist their full political and religious sway to help a benevolent overlord."
 holy_orders_estate_events.1.t: "Revolt of the [Root.GetName] Knights"
 holy_orders_estate_events.1.d: "The disgruntled $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] have risen up against us to reclaim their rights once granted by the Pope."
 holy_orders_estate_events.1.a: "Okay."
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.t: "Knightly Training Proves Successful"
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.d: "It has been a while now since we sent [Root.Heir.GetName] to the members of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ to educate [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] in their abilities. In [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] months of hard training, [Root.Heir.GetName] has not only seen a lot of the world, but has also been able to improve [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] administrative and fighting skills, culminating in an increased level of humbleness to our religion. We should sincerely thank the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ for taking care of the training of our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] so diligently and making [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] an exemplary knight."
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.a: "Reward them generously"
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.b: "That was their job, after all"
 holy_orders_estate_events.3.t: "Extension of the Bailiwicks?"
 holy_orders_estate_events.3.d: "Not only the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ takes over the administration of our provinces, but also the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] excel by their modern methods. They particularly insist on preserving newly conquered territory so that they can take special care of the conversion of heretics and heathens. Do we want to place an additional part of our territory under the control of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ or the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$?"
 holy_orders_estate_events.3.a: "Prefer the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$"
 holy_orders_estate_events.3.b: "Prefer the $ESTATE_CHURCH$"
 holy_orders_estate_events.3.c: "Better keep the land ourselves"
 holy_orders_estate_events.4.t: "Exemption of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$"
 holy_orders_estate_events.4.d: "The $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ have gained considerable influence at the [Root.GetAdjective] court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] in the past years, often providing advisors to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and dominating state affairs today. Even the Holy Father himself has heard of this and has thus passed a decree granting a special position to the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$, freeing them from [Root.GetAdjective] jurisdiction and placing them directly under the authority of the Catholic Church. This means a massive intervention in our internal politics!"
 holy_orders_estate_events.4.a: "All right, then"
 holy_orders_estate_events.4.b: "We can't let that happen"
 holy_orders_estate_events.5.t: "Noble Knights"
 holy_orders_estate_events.5.d: "A serious dispute has broken out between the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ and the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName]. An influential knight, who is an excellent fighter not only in jousting, insists on being elevated to the rank of baron by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], as he, being a bastard, has no inheritance rights. While the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ support him in this - hoping for political advantages by doing so - the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ vigorously rejects this, as they fear for their own power. Whose side do we take?"
 holy_orders_estate_events.5.a: "Elevate this knight"
 holy_orders_estate_events.5.b: "We appreciate the concerns of our high nobility"
 holy_orders_estate_events.6.t: "Uncertain Pilgrimage to Jerusalem"
 holy_orders_estate_events.6.d: "A large group of [Root.GetAdjective] pilgrims wants to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the Holiest City of Christianity. But the route to get there is many hundreds, if not thousands of kilometers long, often leading through rough terrain. To make matters worse, the pilgrims will probably have to cross lands where Christians are unwanted, possibly even persecuted. The $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] however, offer to accompany the travellers to Jerusalem and protect them with their swords from potential danger."
 holy_orders_estate_events.6.a: "Our subjects should be able to travel unmolested"
 holy_orders_estate_events.6.b: "But we need them here, in [Root.GetName]"
 holy_orders_estate_events.7.t: "Resistance of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$"
 holy_orders_estate_events.7.d: "The relations between our court and the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ have become worse than ever. Quite blatantly, they are expressing their aversion to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and denying their loyalty to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. This is an outrageous affront to the feudal liabilities of [Root.GetName] and massively undermines our authority in the [Root.GetAdjective] bailiwicks. How can we defuse this situation?"
 holy_orders_estate_events.7.a: "Show them who's in charge."
 holy_orders_estate_events.7.b: "We mustn't aggravate the situation"
 holy_orders_estate_events.8.t: "$ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ Hospices"
 holy_orders_estate_events.8.d: "In times of war the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ provide medical care and nursing for wounded soldiers, whereas in times of peace they take over the management of almshouses and orphanages. The hospice in one of our cities has been overcrowded for quite some time so that many patients had to be turned away. Therefore, the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ want to get permission from us to expand the existing hospice with a new infirmary in order to be able to continue fulfilling their charitable obligations."
 holy_orders_estate_events.8.a: "Allow this"
 holy_orders_estate_events.8.b: "Forbid this"
 holy_orders_estate_events.9.t: "Fight for the Cross"
 holy_orders_estate_events.9.d: "Many of the knights of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ have acquired renown beyond our borders through the past battles against our religious enemies they fought. In many places, the courage and bravery of our knights are appreciated, whose chivalrousness is also exceptional and outstanding. Verily, they reflect our entire nation's attachment to Christianity, making us all humble Christians."
 holy_orders_estate_events.9.a: "Deus Vult!"
 holy_orders_estate_events.10.t: "Increasing Influence of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$"
 holy_orders_estate_events.10.d: "In recent years, the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] have produced many great soldiers, advisors and administrators. Although the majority of them are knights of lower nobility, they play an important role today not only at our court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], but also throughout our entire realm."
 holy_orders_estate_events.10.a: "Okay."
 holy_orders_estate_events.11.t: "Decreasing Influence of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$"
 holy_orders_estate_events.11.d: "These days, the future of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ in [Root.GetName] is uncertain, as their duties are mostly already entrusted to the [Root.GetAdjective] clergy or nobility. Their political influence has shrunk to the confines of their few hospices or bailiwicks, meaning that they enjoy almost no importance at our court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 holy_orders_estate_events.11.a: "Okay."
