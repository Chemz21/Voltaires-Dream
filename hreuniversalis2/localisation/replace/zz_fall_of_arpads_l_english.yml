 fall_of_arpads.2.t: "The Magnates of [magnate_target.GetName]"
 fall_of_arpads.2.d: "After the disintegration of Hungary, many of our former provinces are still held by powerful magnates, undermining the autocracy of the Hungarian Crown and the legitimacy of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]. Fortunately, not all of them oppose us, many of them emerged as loyal and reliable allies under the Árpád Kings. Since our armies are too weak to take on all the magnates at once, our advisors urge us to take all necessary steps to regain their loyalty through diplomatic means.\n\n[magnate_target.GetName] is currently controlled by [magnate_target.Monarch.GetName] [magnate_target.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], whom we will have to accommodate with concessions in order to renew the oath of allegiance. Therefore, we must struck an agreement with this not to be underestimated adversary, offering [magnate_target.Monarch.GetHerHim] conditions that [magnate_target.Monarch.GetSheHe] deems more valuable than anything [magnate_target.Monarch.GetSheHe] might hope to receive by establishing [magnate_target.Monarch.GetHerHis] own principality or from other pretenders. By doing so, we will slowly regain control of our previous territories and strengthen [Root.Monarch.GetName] as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hungary!"
 fall_of_arpads.2.a: "Overhelm [magnate_target.Monarch.GetHerHim] with gold and honorary titles"
 fall_of_arpads.2.b: "We have the permission of the pope to reclaim [magnate_target.Monarch.GetHerHis] titles"
 fall_of_arpads.2.c: "There's nothing we can do"
 fall_of_arpads.3.t: "Pretender from Abroad"
 fall_of_arpads.3.d: "The succession after the extinction of the Árpád Kings proved to be difficult as several possible candidates were considered by the Hungarian estates to be crowned the new king. One of the disdained noblemen, [Root.foreign_pretender.GetName] from [origin_of_pretender.GetName], together with some Hungarian petty nobles, raised an army and crossed the border of Hungary, trying to seize the royal title for himself. We must put a check on his nefarious attempt to claim the Hungarian Crown!"
 fall_of_arpads.3.a: "Drive him back home!"
 fall_of_arpads.4.t: "Province Demands Autonomy"
 fall_of_arpads.4.d: "Through the loss of control over large parts of Hungary to powerful magnates, cities and petty nobles are also striving for greater autonomy. [province_demanding_autonomy.GetName] is one of these provinces, expecting us to acknowledge it with tax and troop relief. "
 fall_of_arpads.4.a: "We have no choice but to accept this"
 fall_of_arpads.4.b: "Reject these demands!"
 fall_of_arpads.5.t: "The Cuman Question"
 fall_of_arpads.5.d: "The Cumans, once a nomadic tribe living in the eastern steppes, have lived in our realm for ages and have been assimilated by adopting Christianity and Hungarian culture over time. Although the roots of the Hungarian people also lie in the Eurasian plains, there are still frequent tensions between Hungarians and Cumans today. Nevertheless, the Cumans constitute an appreciable part of our state, as they maintain their martial traditions from their nomadic times, thus providing valuable soldiers for the Hungarian Crown.\n\nWe are currently in a difficult situation in which every man capable of fighting is needed for our army. Therefore, we should consider enlisting the assistance of our Cuman subjects, even if this action will upset the Hungarian estates."
 fall_of_arpads.5.a: "We rely on them"
 fall_of_arpads.5.b: "We don't need them"
 fall_of_arpads.6.t: "The Assassination of [UNG.Monarch.GetName] [UNG.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]"
 fall_of_arpads.6.d: "We have been informed that [UNG.Monarch.GetName] [UNG.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], [UNG.Monarch.GetTitle] of Ung, was murdered by local burghers during a stay in Kassa. We could make use of [UNG.Monarch.GetHerHis] death as a basis for integrating the provinces governed by [UNG.Monarch.GetHerHim] back into the kingdom, which will require us to reinterpret the relationship between ourselves and the [UNG.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family however. By forcing them to refrain from arbitrarily raised customs duties, by demanding the king's permission to build new castles, and by placing the local nobility under royal jurisdiction, we will certainly be able to restrict the autonomy of [UNG.Monarch.GetName]'s relatives and regain control of Ung for the Hungarian Crown."
 fall_of_arpads.6.a: "Enforce our demands and seize their property"
 fall_of_arpads.6.b: "Tolerate them as autonomous provincial lords"
 fall_of_arpads.7.t: "Treachery in Ung"
 fall_of_arpads.7.d: "After their possessions and properties were recently confiscated by the Hungarian Crown, members of the family of the former voivode of Ung revolted against [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The sons of the deceased magnate are leading this rebellion, trying to regain the lost titles of their father."
 fall_of_arpads.7.a: "Let them pay for this!"
 fall_of_arpads.8.t: "The King's Rival"
 fall_of_arpads.8.d: "As a result of the succession crisis in Hungary, we lost control of Nitra, which is administered by [SLO.Monarch.GetName] [SLO.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], who does not only repudiate [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule, but was already considered a troublemaker and opponent of the Crown under the Árpáds. We are sure that at this very moment [SLO.Monarch.GetSheHe] is making secret plans with our enemies in Austria, Bohemia or Poland, so that [SLO.Monarch.GetSheHe] will be able to openly oppose the Hungarian Kingdom. It will be difficult to convince him to entirely submit to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], thus we may have to force [SLO.Monarch.GetHerHim] to do so with our knights and arms."
 fall_of_arpads.8.a: "Let [SLO.Monarch.GetHerHim] lick our floors"
 fall_of_arpads.8.b: "Appease [SLO.Monarch.GetHerHim] diplomatically"
 fall_of_arpads.8.c: "Waive our claims in Nitra"
 fall_of_arpads.9.t: "Tyranny in Transylvania"
 fall_of_arpads.9.d: "The [TRA.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family is one of the most influential and largest noble families of Hungary, which has acquired large estates in Transylvania in the last decades, whereby they have emancipated as governors of this region. [TRA.Monarch.GetName] [TRA.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], current [TRA.Monarch.GetTitle] of Transylvania, has taken advantage of the period of instability in the Hungarian Kingdom to expand [TRA.Monarch.GetHerHis] own power in Transylvania. [TRA.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] did not only subdue and suppress the Saxons living there, but also unlawfully occupied valuable silver mines and seized several counties for [TRA.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]. If we do not put an immediate stop to [TRA.Monarch.GetHerHis] authoritarian and arbitrary actions, [TRA.Monarch.GetSheHe] will probably renounce the Crown and establish [TRA.Monarch.GetHerHis] own independent principality."
 fall_of_arpads.9.a: "[TRA.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] must bow to the Hungarian Crown"
 fall_of_arpads.9.b: "We will not intervene and grant [TRA.Monarch.GetHerHim] autonomy"
 fall_of_arpads.9.c: "Abandon Transylvania"
 fall_of_arpads.10.t: "The Order of Saint George"
 fall_of_arpads.10.d: "With the extinction of the Árpád Kings and the coronation of a foreigner, the political and social life in Hungary has been stirred up to our disadvantage, affecting future generations as well. Therefore, our advisors propose the establishment of a secular Holy Order to strengthen chivalrous culture in Hungary, which will benefit the Crown and Church in the process.\n\nIts knights will not be subordinate to the Church, but directly to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], which will transform the members into the most respected knights in entire Hungary. Their chivalrous duties will be not only to ensure the King's safety, but also to protect Christianity, to give the light of the holidays and to protect the sick and wounded. Should we create such a noble order?"
 fall_of_arpads.10.a: "Fund this religious order"
 fall_of_arpads.10.b: "Renounce it"
 fall_of_arpads.11.t: "Unrests in Croatia"
 fall_of_arpads.11.d: "Riots have broken out in our Croatian provinces, where the locals are rebelling against us in order to shake off our supremacy and restore the Croatian kingdom. We must stop them!"
