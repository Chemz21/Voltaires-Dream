 fall_of_arpads.2.t: "The Magnates of [magnate_target.GetName]"
 fall_of_arpads.2.d: "The family of [magnate_target.Monarch.GetName] [magnate_target.GetName.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], [magnate_target.GetName.Monarch.GetTitle] of [magnate_target.GetName.GetName], proved to be faithful allies of the Crown under the Árpád Kings of Hungary. For this reason, our advisors propose to persuade them to renew the oath of allegiance to the recently crowned [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], thus binding them back to the Hungarian Crown. However, they are divided on the most appropriate method of achieving this."
 fall_of_arpads.2.a: "Offer him a coveted position at our court"
 fall_of_arpads.2.b: "Promise him increased autonomy"
 fall_of_arpads.2.c: "Try to win the consent of his relatives"
 fall_of_arpads.2.dd: "Send a papal legate"

 fall_of_arpads.3.t: "Pretender from Abroad"
 fall_of_arpads.3.d: "[Root.foreign_pretender.GetName], a pretender from [origin_of_pretender.GetName], who was only the second choice of the Hungarian estates in the succession of the extinct Árpáds, has assembled an army and crossed the Hungarian border without our permission. We must put a check on his nefarious attempt to claim the Hungarian Crown!"
 fall_of_arpads.3.a: "Drive him back home!"
 fall_of_arpads.4.t: "Province Demands Autonomy"
 fall_of_arpads.4.d: "Through the loss of control over large parts of Hungary to powerful magnates, cities and petty nobles are also striving for greater autonomy. [province_demanding_autonomy.GetName] is one of these provinces, expecting us to acknowledge it with tax and troop relief. "
 fall_of_arpads.4.a: "We have no choice but to accept this"
 fall_of_arpads.4.b: "Reject these demands!"
 fall_of_arpads.5.t: "The Cuman Question"
 fall_of_arpads.5.d: "The Cumans, once a nomadic tribe living in the eastern steppes, have lived in our realm for ages and have been assimilated by adopting Christianity and Hungarian culture over time. Although the roots of the Hungarian people also lie in the Eurasian plains, there are still frequent tensions between Hungarians and Cumans today. Nevertheless, the Cumans constitute an appreciable part of our state, as they maintain their martial traditions from their nomadic times, thus providing valuable soldiers for the Hungarian Crown.\n\nWe are currently in a difficult situation in which every man capable of fighting is needed for our army. Therefore, we should consider enlisting the assistance of our Cuman subjects, even if this action will upset the Hungarian estates."
 fall_of_arpads.5.a: "We rely on them"
 fall_of_arpads.5.b: "We don't need them"
 fall_of_arpads.6.t: "The Assassination of Amadé Aba"
 fall_of_arpads.6.d: "We have been informed that Amadé Aba, [UNG.Monarch.GetTitle] of Ung, was murdered by local burghers during a stay in Kassa. We could make use of his death as a basis for integrating the provinces governed by him back into the kingdom, which will require us to reinterpret the relationship between ourselves and the Aba family however. By forcing them to refrain from arbitrarily raised customs duties, by demanding the king's permission to build new castles, and by placing the local nobility under royal jurisdiction, we will certainly be able to restrict the autonomy of Amadé's relatives and regain control of Ung for the Hungarian Crown."
 fall_of_arpads.6.a: "Enforce our demands and seize their property"
 fall_of_arpads.6.b: "Tolerate them as autonomous provincial lords"
 fall_of_arpads.6.tt: "All of their provinces get '§YTreaty of Kassa§!' for 25 years, giving the following effects:\nLocal Unrest: §R+5.00§!\nState Maintenance: §R+25.0%§!\nLocal Autonomy Change: §G-0.25§!"
 fall_of_arpads.7.t: "Treachery in Ung"
 fall_of_arpads.7.d: "After their possessions and properties were recently confiscated by the Hungarian Crown, members of the Aba family of Ung revolted against [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The sons of the deceased Amadé Aba are leading this rebellion, trying to regain the lost titles of their father."
 fall_of_arpads.7.a: "Let them pay for this!"
 fall_of_arpads.8.t: "The King's Rival"
 fall_of_arpads.8.d: "As a result of the succession crisis in Hungary, we lost control of Nitra, which is administered by Máté Csák, who does not only repudiate [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule, but was already considered a troublemaker and opponent of the Crown under the Árpáds. We are sure that at this very moment he is making secret plans with our enemies in Austria, Bohemia or Poland, so that he will be able to openly oppose the Hungarian Kingdom. It will be difficult to convince him to entirely submit to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], thus we may have to force him to do so with our knights and arms."
 fall_of_arpads.8.a: "Let him lick our floors"
 fall_of_arpads.8.b: "Appease him diplomatically"
 fall_of_arpads.8.tt: "We will lose all cores in their provinces."
 fall_of_arpads.9.t: "Tyranny in Transylvania"
 fall_of_arpads.9.d: "The Kán family is one of the most influential and largest noble families of Hungary, which has acquired large estates in Transylvania in the last decades, whereby they have emancipated as governors of this region. László Kán, current [TRA.Monarch.GetTitle] of Transylvania, has taken advantage of the period of instability in the Hungarian Kingdom to expand his own power in Transylvania. He did not only subdue and suppress the Saxons living there, but also unlawfully occupied valuable silver mines and seized several counties for himself. If we do not put an immediate stop to his authoritarian and arbitrary actions, he could possibly renounce the Crown and establish his own independent principality."
 fall_of_arpads.9.a: "He must bow to the Hungarian Crown"
 fall_of_arpads.9.b: "We will not intervene and grant him autonomy"
