 black_death.1.t: "Black Death"
 black_death.1.d: "We have heard that it began somewhere in the East, and that a certain sieging horde army on the Black Sea spread it to foolish Genoese tradesmen, who had brought it to their homeland before they knew anything was off. Regardless of where it came from, it's here. Black welts drawn straight from the maw of Hell cover infected citizens and soon lead them to almost certain death - the Greeks have taken to calling these vile inflammations 'buboes', while learned men around the continent try desperately to find an effective treatment. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has isolated [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in the governmental palaces to avoid contracting the disease, but it seems to strike everywhere. Neither gods nor kings can withstand its influence, which some theorize corrupts the air itself. For now, we can only pray the outbreak of the disease will be brief, and our nation will not be too destabilized by this turn of events."
 black_death.1.a: "These are the times that try men's souls"
 black_death.2.t: "Mass Death Strikes Province"
 black_death.2.d: "The Black Death has struck hard, and has quickly begun to spread through the most populous areas of the province. Thousands have been infected already, and we could potentially see the depopulation of entire cities if the disease spirals out of control."
 black_death.2.a: "Send doctors to investigate"
 black_death.2.b: "Damage Control with quarantines!"
 black_death.3.t: "Minor Outbreak"
 black_death.3.d: "Despite our best efforts, an outbreak of the Black Death has struck an urban center. Trade and normal civic enterprises have been completely derailed as families hide inside to escape the disease's wrath and neighbors turn on each other in fits of paranoia."
 black_death.3.a: "Memento Mori"
 black_death.3.b: "Grant any aid possible"
 black_death.4.t: "Troops Infected"
 black_death.4.d: "It was only natural that once the disease started hitting the civilian population it would spread to armies - after all, it was an army that brought it to our continent. Our capability to wage war and defend the nation will be severely crippled if fighting-aged men are wiped out en masse."
 black_death.4.a: "An opportunity to study..."
 black_death.4.b: "Give proper burials"
 black_death.5.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Contracts Plague!"
 black_death.5.d: "The nightmare scenario has come to pass. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has been infected by the Black Death, and even the best-trained natural philosophers worry this might be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death. The nation's magnates wait on edge to see if the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will pull through, but few have managed to survive such a curse."

[Root.Heir.GetName] has been stricken by the Black Death, and now clings onto life by only a fateful thread. In truth, [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] death could mean the descent of the state into lawless anarchy and civil war if the rest of the royal family is also wiped out."

 black_death.7.d: "The Pope has gotten wind of our attempts to combat the Black Death and claims our use of unceremonious burials, experimentation on cadavers, and co-opting of church resources is an unholy outrage. He maintains that even in these trying times we must observe the faith if we are to survive. The legate he sent awaits our assurances that we will end such practices and reimburse the church."

 black_death.8.b: "We cannot afford it"
 black_death.9.t: "Paranoid Unrest"
 black_death.9.d: "The citizens of one of our provinces have heard grim rumors about how the state deals with infected populations, and the severity of quarantines. Several rabble-rousers have driven the populace into a frenzy, ready to boil over into open revolt, unless we recall all plague-fighting officials and assure them no quarantines will be issued against their towns."
 black_death.9.a: "Bow to the demands"
 black_death.9.b: "We'll show them death..."
 black_death.10.t: "Foreign Advice"
 black_death.10.d: "One of the neighboring states has succeeded in clearing the Black Death from their population and fortifying their borders against further outbreaks. They have gracefully sent learned men to give us advice on how to fight this unholy disease in our own lands."
 black_death.10.a: "A great boon!"
 black_death.100.t: "End of the Black Death"
 black_death.100.d: "It would seem that the ravages of the Black Death have finally burned themselves out, as medical advancements and population thinning have rendered them powerless. The citizenry is cautiously returning to normal life and even a few trading hubs have re-opened business. Though the disease was damaging to our nation, we emerge more resilient than ever."

#Revolt of the Earls

 revolt_of_the_earls.1.d: "Our hold over the Anglo-Saxon lords of England is in a precarious situation, as pretenders roam the lands seeking to throw off a perceived foreign yoke and even many of our own magnates foment rebellion out of a conniving desire for personal power. It is clear that we must either replace these Anglo-Saxon power enclaves wholesale or lose the Kingdom."
 revolt_of_the_earls.1.a: "Time to confiscate their titles!"
 revolt_of_the_earls.2.t: "Saxon Lord Demands Privileges"
 revolt_of_the_earls.2.d: "Another one of the Anglo-Saxon magnates who ruled England under the house of Wessex has expressed his grievances with the current government, complaining that his hereditary rights established long ago are being infringed. He suggests the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is a mere pretender and demands sweeping autonomy within his shired holdings - a series of provincial subdivisions the Saxons call 'hundreds'."
 revolt_of_the_earls.2.a: "Have him replaced"
 revolt_of_the_earls.2.b: "Recognize his rights"
 revolt_of_the_earls.3.t: "New Norman Stronghold"
 revolt_of_the_earls.3.d: "We have identified a certain Anglo-Saxon shire as the perfect position for a new Norman powerbase. Installing a loyal Norman lord as its new commander will spread our influence throughout the area and increase our stranglehold over these rebellious lands. However, the local population, used to a degree of autonomy, will not be happy with their new overlord."

 revolt_of_the_earls.3.b: "Install a native instead"
 revolt_of_the_earls.4.t: "The Domesday Book"
 revolt_of_the_earls.4.d: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s advisors claim that the old Anglo-Saxon Kings of England, and certainly the chaotic Norsemen who ruled parts of the realm periodically, were poor keepers of property records. To figure out exactly what taxes are owed to the crown and get the lay of local magnates' power structures, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has considered the commissioning of a 'domesday book', so called for its likeness to the Biblical book of records at Last Judgment. The book would be an unprecedented record of all English holdings, and an invaluable resource in solidifying the redistribution of Anglo-Saxon titles to new Norman lords.\n\nOf course, its creation would be a monumental administrative effort..."
 revolt_of_the_earls.4.a: "Commission it!"
 revolt_of_the_earls.4.b: "We can work on an Ad Hoc basis"
 revolt_of_the_earls.5.t: "Edgar the Aetheling"
 revolt_of_the_earls.5.d: "It turns out the house of Cerdic - the royal dynasty of Wessex - was not totally extinguished with our conquest of the English realm. One final male claimant remains, a great grandson of Eadweard the Confessor's father, Aethelred the Unready - they call him Edgar the 'Aetheling', meaning 'Prince'. The remnants of the old Saxon witenagemot have proclaimed him King in defiance of our rule, and many disenfranchised nobles have already flocked to his cause! It is rumored that he plans to march on [Root.Capital.GetName] with an army and re-establish Anglo-Saxon rule of England."
 revolt_of_the_earls.5.a: "We'll hang him from the [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] walls"
 revolt_of_the_earls.6.t: "Norman Earl Defects!"
 revolt_of_the_earls.6.d: "One of the Norman retainers we graciously issued an English title has repaid our kindness with a knife to the back! Edgar the Aetheling, serpent in man's clothing, has somehow convinced him to support his godless rebellion and give shelter to revolutionaries. If we do not put a stop to this outrageous behavior at once, the situation could easily explode into a popular uprising of Norman and Saxon lords alike."
 revolt_of_the_earls.6.a: "Curtail the nobility"
 revolt_of_the_earls.6.b: "Revoke his title by force"
 revolt_of_the_earls.7.t: "Garrison betrayed!"
 revolt_of_the_earls.7.d: "A force of besieged Norman troops was taken by surprise when the Anglo-Saxon populace of the city opened the gates in the dead of night and invited the heathen Pretenders inside! Our brave and loyal men were slaughtered without mercy - these insurgent dogs will pay for their unforgivable insolence once we have retaken our rightful fort!"
 revolt_of_the_earls.7.a: "Disastrous..."
 revolt_of_the_earls.8.t: "Saxon Lord Entrenched"
 revolt_of_the_earls.8.d: "One of the Saxon magnates appointed under the Cerdicingas has gotten wind of our plan to strip him of his title and re-grant it to a Norman retainer who had demonstrated great courage in our conquest of the realm. He has started gathering supplies in preparation for resistance, and has no intention of bowing to our wishes."

 revolt_of_the_earls.100.t: "Revolts Put Down"
 revolt_of_the_earls.100.d: "The unrest gripping the England Kingdom has finally subsided, as the Crown is unified under a singular cultural power structure. Let us hope Albion will never again be stricken by such civil strife, and may enjoy future prosperity as a united entity."

 revolt_of_the_earls.9.t: "Welsh Revolt Brewing"
 revolt_of_the_earls.9.d: "Our spies tell us of a plot amongst our Welsh subjects to revolt against our rule and defect to a Welsh state. They have gone to one of the extant Welsh polities to request support for this abortive folly, and we hear the ruler in question is mulling over the choice."
 revolt_of_the_earls.9.a: "Let us hope they choose wisely"
 revolt_of_the_earls.10.t: "Welsh Rebels Request Support"
 revolt_of_the_earls.10.d: "A group of Welshmen living under the rule of England are organizing an uprising against English rule while the realm is engulfed by civil unrest. Due to our prestigious position among the Welsh states, they have asked for our help in supplying and training their troops. The English, of course, will surely know about our malfeasance if we agree to this arrangement, however."
 revolt_of_the_earls.10.a: "Send troops"
 revolt_of_the_earls.10.b: "Decline the offer"
 revolt_of_the_earls.11.t: "Welsh Support Rebels"
 revolt_of_the_earls.11.d: "We have received word that [From.GetName] has indeed supported a rebellion of our Welsh subjects, directly funding their insurrection against our rule. We will punish them for this outrage at the earliest opportunity!"

 revolt_of_the_earls.12.d: "We have received word that [From.GetName] has decided not to support a rebellion planned by some of our Welsh subjects. We are grateful that they would remain above such unscrupulous activities."
 revolt_of_the_earls.12.a: "A wise choice"
 revolt_of_the_earls.13.t: "Rebels Seek Scottish Support"
 revolt_of_the_earls.13.d: "A faction of discontented Anglo-Saxon petty nobles is apparently going to Alba for help in their revolt against our rightful rule. They believe they can convince the Scots to launch a mass invasion of our nation from the north and distract us from dealing with the unrest throughout the realm."
 revolt_of_the_earls.13.a: "Bribe them"
 revolt_of_the_earls.13.b: "Prepare the border forts"

 revolt_of_the_earls.14.d: "The Anglo-Saxon subjects of the new English rulers wisely prefer our benevolent rule to that of their corrupt and villainous tyrant. They have formally invited us to invade England and free them from their late strife."
 revolt_of_the_earls.14.a: "Wonderful!"
 revolt_of_the_earls.15.t: "Norman Nobles Incensed"
 revolt_of_the_earls.15.d: "The nobility left behind in Normandy is concerned with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s attention to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] new holdings in the British Isles, and jealous of the lords who received new titles in reward for their service. They demand that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] appoint a family member to personally rule over Normandy in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] name, and threaten to refuse feudal service if we do not bow to their demands."
 revolt_of_the_earls.15.a: "Ignore them"
 revolt_of_the_earls.15.b: "I guess we have no choice"
 revolt_of_the_earls.16.t: "Northumbrians Join with Saxons"
 revolt_of_the_earls.16.d: "The Northumbrians have long had a distinct culture amongst the Anglo-Saxon nations, displaying a unique ferocity in warfare, a distinctive local dialect, and extensive intermixing with the Viking Norsemen. In the case of the Anglo-Saxon resistance against our state, however, they have made it clear with whom they side. We will now need to head up north and reign them in as well."

 byz_crisis_stop.tt: "Neither Byzantium nor its subjects border a Muslim state"
 byz_crisis.1.t: "The Battle of Manzikert"
 byz_crisis.1.d: "Continued cat-and-mouse raids along the Byzantine-Seljuk border invoked the ire of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], who finally amassed a large army of Imperial troops, Varangians, and foreign mercenaries, even including a group of Turks. The great Seljuk Sultan, Alp Arslan, was rumored to likewise be the personal leader of the latest marauding Turkish army. In the narrow passage at Manzikert, the two great armies met in an unavoidable engagement.\n\nAs the dust kicked up by the fearsome horses cleared, the full extent of the catastrophe became apparent. The cowardly 'mercenary' Franks had abandoned the battlefield, and the ancient Varangian Guard was wiped out entirely. The greatest nobles of the Byzantine Empire were either killed or captured, with the Turks demanding a ransom that would shake the Imperial coffers to the core. Though this defeat doesn't spell the wholesale collapse of our Empire, the way for further Turkish expansion into Anatolia now lies wide open."
 byz_crisis.1.a: "Disastrous news"
 byz_crisis.2.t: "Turks Raid Province!"
 byz_crisis.2.d: "A small Turkish army has broken through the Byzantine Limes and wreaked havoc on the countryside. The local governor begs for the protection of the Imperial Army, and fears that the region may be lost entirely to the Turks without immediate attention."

 byz_crisis.2.b: "Ignore it"
 byz_crisis.3.t: "Turks Raid Province!"
 byz_crisis.3.d: "The Turks have staged an incursion deep into our territories, slaughtering villages and carrying away great piles of loot. This theft of Imperial property is unconscionable, and our Strategos recommends we divert a contingent of troops to guard the affected region."
 byz_crisis.3.a: "Send resources"
 byz_crisis.3.b: "Ignore it"
 byz_crisis.4.t: "Turks Raid Coast!"
 byz_crisis.4.d: "Turkish attacks on coastal lands in Anatolia have gotten out of control, with certain coastal forts being seized for weeks before local forces could drive out the heathen invaders.

 byz_crisis.4.a: "Send resources"
 byz_crisis.4.b: "Ignore it"
 byz_crisis.5.t: "Turks Raid Coast!"
 byz_crisis.5.d: "A Turkish fleet has sallied out from the Levant to pester Byzantine shipping and coastal cities. Many citizens have even been stolen away as slaves. The local Strategos insists that the Imperial navy needs to turn their attention to the area and provide extra sailors."

 byz_crisis.5.b: "Ignore it"
 byz_crisis.6.t: "Turks Raid Supply Lines!"
 byz_crisis.6.d: "The Turks have made a precision strike on our supply lines and roads, throwing the flow of administrative logistics into chaos.

 byz_crisis.8.t: "Shah-Armens"
 byz_crisis.8.d: "One of the first regions left exposed by the disaster at Manzikert was the former Armenian province of Vaspurakan, which is separated from the imperial capital by dense mountains. A group of Turks have declared this region their new capital, daring to call themselves 'Shah-Armens' - Kings of Armenia.\n\nWe cannot stand for this insolence!"
 byz_crisis.8.a: "The Armenians will have to fend for themselves"
 byz_crisis.8.b: "To war!"
 byz_crisis.8.c: "Join their rebellion..."
 byz_crisis.8.c: "Join their rebellion"
 byz_crisis.9.t: "Taronites Abandon Us"
 byz_crisis.9.d: "The noble Armenian family of Taronites, ruling the principality of Taron, was one of the first brought into the Byzantine fold by our great leader Nikephoros Phokas in the tenth century. Sensing the writing on the wall in the wake of Manzikert, they now dare to rally their Armenian subjects against imperial rule and declare themselves once again Princes of Taron and Sasun."
 byz_crisis.9.a: "Their loss..."
 byz_crisis.9.b: "They must be forced back!"
 byz_crisis.10.t: "Saltukids"
 byz_crisis.10.d: "Theodosiopolis is one of our greatest cities in Eastern Anatolia, having been brought under Byzantine control during the wave of reconquests we carried out in the tenth century. It has now once again fallen to foreigners, but this time it is heathen Turks rather than misguided Armenians who hold it. They call the city 'Erzurum' in their barbarian tongue, declaring the region their new homeland in the name of their leader Saltuk."

 byz_crisis.10.b: "To war!"
 byz_crisis.11.t: "Mengüjekids"
 byz_crisis.11.d: "After Theodosiopolis and Koloneia, the city of Akilisene is one of the most important defensive centers for our eastern frontier. A barbarian tribe under the leadership of a certain 'Mengüjek' has captured the city after a short siege, and rather than merely raiding it, they presume to establish it as their new capital!\n\nThe barbarians have slurred the proper name of the city into 'Erzincan' - an outrage against Greek culture that we must correct."
 byz_crisis.11.a: "Ta panta rhei, kai ouden menei"
 byz_crisis.11.b: "To War!"
 byz_crisis.12.t: "Çubukids"
 byz_crisis.12.d: "The terminus of the Euphrates river has long stood as an important defensive line against foreign raids, with its string of fortresses and tall mountains. While we were distracted by the fallout of the Battle of Manzikert, however, a group of Turks under the command of their chieftain Çubuk have seized the region's forts and declared it a new Turkish beylik. This will seriously undermine our power in Eastern Anatolia."
 byz_crisis.12.a: "There is nothing we can do"
 byz_crisis.12.b: "To war!"
 byz_crisis.13.t: "The Revolt of Philaretos Brachamios"
 byz_crisis.13.d: "The commander assigned to southeast Anatolia was a talented Armenian by the name of Vahram Varaznuni, known in Greek as Philaretos Brachamios. In the power vacuum left by Manzikert, however, Brachamios' status as the only local commander with an intact army has coaxed him into declaring himself the new Byzantine Emperor and revolting against the true imperial government with the support of most of the region.\n\nWithout his loyalty, our prospects are grim."
 byz_crisis.13.a: "Let the pretenders pretend"
 byz_crisis.13.b: "Step down and accept his claim"

 byz_crisis.14.d: "The Domestikos of Antioch, Ioseph Tarchaneiotes, was supposed to reinforce the army at Manzikert with a vanguard. He never arrived. It is now clear that Ioseph is acting in defiance of the imperial government, hiding like a coward in his former lands instead of fighting back against the invading Turks.\n\nIt will be difficult to dislodge him from Cyprus with naval discipline collapsing left and right."
 byz_crisis.14.a: "Cyprus is a lost cause"
 byz_crisis.14.b: "We must attempt"
 byz_crisis.15.t: "Danishmends"
 byz_crisis.15.d: "While the empire is familiar with Danish men, who have served in the now-defunct Varangian Guard for generations, Danishmends are a new problem. This group of Turks under the command of Danishmend Ghazi has now occupied the fertile plains across the Alys river, cutting off our supply lines into the East.\n\nIf we are to turn them back, we must act quickly."
 byz_crisis.15.a: "We can take it back later"
 byz_crisis.15.b: "To war!"
 byz_crisis.16.t: "Strategos Abandons Us"
 byz_crisis.16.d: "The Strategos of the Theme of Chaldia has concluded that the imperial government cannot defend him and he will have to take over all military and administrative affairs in his own province. In effect, he has begun to act independent of the empire in all but name. With all the chaos the Turks are causing in the rest of Anatolia, it seems fruitless to attempt to rein him back in again."
 byz_crisis.16.a: "Let him go"
 byz_crisis.16.b: "We will show him the reach of the empire"
 byz_crisis.17.t: "A Rogue Mercenary"
 byz_crisis.17.d: "One of the Norman mercenaries who escaped the Battle of Manzikert was an adventurer named Roussel de Bailleul. Due to the desperate situation, we had to act against our better judgment by sending him onto the field again, but unsurprisingly he has betrayed his loyalty to the imperial government and used his troops to declare himself the independent ruler of Phrygia.\n\nThe traitor ought to be brought to Constantinople and hung from the hippodrome for all to see after these grave acts of treason."
 byz_crisis.17.a: "Maybe he can act as a buffer"
 byz_crisis.17.b: "Perfidious Franks!"
 byz_crisis.18.t: "A Pretender Rises"
 byz_crisis.18.d: "For centuries the Themes presented a problem to the imperial government as powerful Strategoi would use their troops to seize the throne. It was precisely for this reason that the Themes were broken into smaller units, but in the state of emergency following Manzikert we had to place several of the largest themes under the skilled general Nikephoros Botaneiates.\n\nHe has repaid our munificence by treasonously declaring himself the true Emperor and announcing his intent to rally the Thematic troops for a march on Constantinople, promising better leadership."
 byz_crisis.18.a: "Let the pretenders pretend"
 byz_crisis.18.b: "Maybe he is right..."
 byz_crisis.18.c: "We will march to meet him!"
 byz_crisis.19.t: "Uprising of Georgi Voyteh"
 byz_crisis.19.d: "Only a few decades ago were the Bulgarians finally pacified by the great Emperor Basil 'the Bulgar slayer', so it is unsurprising that treasonous elements have capitalized on our misfortune by rising up instead of helping to fight off the heathen Turks.

 byz_crisis.20.d: "Following the Byzantine defeat at Manzikert, the royal Seljuk clan made little attempt to break through our reinforced borders in western Anatolia. Now, however, internal politics have led Byzantine traitors to buy the Turks' support by turning open the gates of major Bithynian cities to a Seljuk prince... a heathen who has the gall to call himself 'Sultan of Rum'! This villain has directed his full attention toward the complete conquest of Anatolia and the export of Islam to the west."

Lesser princes far from the royal line of succession may even act against the main Turkish forces, cooperating with Greeks to advance their own interests.\n\nOne such prince is a pirate and warlord known to us as 'Tzachas', who has rebelled against our employment and taken up residence in the islands along the Aegean coast of Asia minor. Though he is hostile to many other Islamic powers, his powerbase is nevertheless dangerously close to Greece itself, and he has even taken to styling himself Byzantine Emperor, plotting to capture our capital."

 byz_crisis.23.d: "In days past we assigned the governorship of Tarsus and Cilicia at large to a curious Armenian from the noble Artsruni line who bore the Arabic name 'Abu'l-Gharib'. He is better known to us as Apnelgaripes, and has proved loyal in the past due to his conversion to the Orthodox Church, which in turn has incurred the resentment of his own Miaphysite people. Despite this liability, he has begun acting independently of the Imperial government and has essentially made himself prince of the Armenians in Cilicia."

More recently it has been placed under the command of our naval Megas Doux, but its governor, a certain Karykes, has revolted against the weakened Imperial state to foolishly seek out independence on the grounds that we are not protecting the island from Turkish piracy.\n\nThe loss of Crete will be a great blow to our naval strategy and our control of trade through the Aegean Sea."

Tengribirmish has successfully captured many of the important forts in the region and rather than swearing allegiance to the far-away Seljuk Padishah, he has decided to found his own state on our lands!"

 byz_crisis.25.b: "Now there are two of them?"

 byz_crisis.100.d: "With much of Anatolia lost, the Byzantine [Root.GovernmentName] is in a state of chaos, now dealing with attempted conquests by the Seljuks and ambitious Italian powers. The current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s weakness has caused unrest throughout the heartlands, and a skilled general named Alexios Komnenos has proved his worth by putting down many rebellions and defending against hostile powers.\nThis Alexios seems to have near universal support, and abdicating in favor of him might be the only way to save Byzantium from further calamities. However, doing so might also open the [Root.GovernmentName] up to even more invasions under the pretext of monarchical illegitimacy."

#Peoples' Spring
 peoples_spring.1.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Peoples' Spring"
 peoples_spring.1.d: "The continuing social problems of recent years, such as poverty, famine, the decline of traditional crafts and general social hardships, have led to the revolt of the [Root.GetAdjective] proletariat. After an assembly lasting several days, its representatives presented a collection of liberal and democratic demands, such as guaranteeing freedom of the press and the establishment of a parliament, to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the [Root.GetAdjective] state. The coming weeks will be decisive for the future of our nation when it will be seen how far these revolutionaries can impose their demands."

 peoples_spring.2.t: "Factory Workers on Strike"
 peoples_spring.2.d: "In many of our provinces, factory workers have laid down their weapons to demonstrate against the terrible living and working conditions. Many of them work for ten hours or more a day, live in ghettos or slums, have no social insurances, are underpaid and even children often have to work in the factories. Should we try to improve their situation or oppress them?"
 peoples_spring.2.a: "Reject their demands categorically"
 peoples_spring.2.b: "We must take their concerns seriously"
 peoples_spring.3.t: "Revolutionary Universities"
 peoples_spring.3.d: "We have heard that the revolution has spilled over into our universities of our country. Not only the students are spreading flyers with revolutionary contents or rallying for demonstrations criticizing the [Root.GetAdjective] regime, but also the lecturers and professors are raising the students against us. We must counteract this immediately!"

 peoples_spring.4.d: "Fearing to lose their jobs due to the advancing mechanization caused by industrialization, many impoverished factory workers in [manufactory_province.GetName] have joined the national uprisings. In order to demand better wages and working conditions from the entrepreneurs and to prevent the hiring of unskilled but cheap labour, they have destroyed the factories' machinery or devastated the building sites of factories under construction. Our economy will suffer significantly if further factories have to be closed down entirely because of such riots."

 peoples_spring.5.d: "The [nationalist_province_1.Culture.GetName] people living under our rule, incited by the ongoing national disturbances, have stirred up arms against us in order to establish a sovereign state, as they consider themselves a second-class people. If we do not repress them, they may not only enforce their demands, but motivate further rebellions in our [Root.GovernmentName]."

 peoples_spring.6.t: "Censorship of the Press"
 peoples_spring.6.d: "Only our state authorities control and determine what our printers may print and our journalists may write. One of the most important standpoints of the revolutionaries is to abolish such directives and establish the freedom of the press.

Their dissatisfaction was expressed that day at the bakers, butchers and farmers of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], where withheld food was confiscated by the insurgents.

Inspired by the performance of a nationalist opera, Belgian revolutionaries have begun to loot and occupy government buildings in our cities throughout the country, on which the Belgian tricolor now wafts.\nThe newly convened assembly of revolutionaries demands the separation of Belgian territory from the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] and the recognition of an independent Belgian nation. This is an outrageous demand, but it may prove to be the only way to overcome the crisis in the long term."

 peoples_spring.9.t: "Belgium Calls for Aid"
 peoples_spring.9.d: "Decades of cultural and religious differences in the lowlands have resulted in the emergence of a Belgian [BGU.GovernmentName], that has broken away from the Netherlands. Consequently, the Dutch [NED.Monarch.GetTitle] will desperately try to regain the territories occupied by the Belgians by all possible means, which brings up the question of whether we should intervene in this conflict and assist the Belgian revolutionaries.\nBy supporting this Belgian state, we will not only be able to gain a valuable ally, but also strengthen our trade influence in the North Sea against Dutch merchants."

 peoples_spring.10.t: "Revolutionary Thinkers"
 peoples_spring.10.d.a: "A political agitator named Karl Marx has recently come to prominence for his critiques of [Root.GetAdjective] society. He has been organizing meetings with other intellectuals who share his beliefs, and spreading dangerous ideas through pamphlets and public proclamations. He claims that the the power of the global aristocracy has been usurped by the bourgeoisie, turning [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s into mere puppets, and that in turn the common people will inevitably rise up to overthrow these upstart burghers and establish their own stateless societies!\nMarx's proposals are deeply threatening, but arresting him may only make things worse. Perhaps we could grudgingly allow him to continue and keep an eye on his cohorts."
 peoples_spring.10.d.b: "Building off the writings and theories of the radical Karl Marx, another German thinker named Friedrich Engels has spread similar 'communistic' ideas within our state. In particular, he has criticized the abject conditions of the [Root.GetAdjective] working class, claiming they sell their humanity piecemeal by the day for pittances. This inane slander of our beneficent government and society should not be allowed to continue!\nAt the same time, simply censoring Engels may only make his dangerous ideas more appealing to the masses. We must tread carefully in dealing with this man."
 peoples_spring.10.d.c: "A certain writer who haunts various intellectual spheres in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has recently made a name for himself with his radical pamphlets advocating for the so-called 'communist' ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. These pamphlets are being widely read by the [Root.GetAdjective] masses and aristocracy alike, and have caused quite a stir. It has been claimed that this radical author is advocating open sedition against our government!\nIf we arrest this man and put a stop to his pamphleteering, it may only suggest to the people that we consider him a threat. Perhaps ignoring him would be better."
 peoples_spring.10.a: "Let him rabble-rouse"
 peoples_spring.10.b: "He must be arrested!"
 peoples_spring.11.t: "The Greek Revolution"
 peoples_spring.11.d: "Centuries of boiling revolutionary sentiment have been bolstered by the recent rise of nationalism among the ethnic minorities in our [Root.GovernmentName] to produce open defiance among the Greeks. Under the leadership of a series of radical thinkers and leaders such as Alexandros Ypsilantis and Theodoros Kolokotronis, they are now demanding that the Sublime Porte recognize their full autonomy, and threaten that the streets of Athens will run with Ottoman blood if we do not give in to their demands!\nThis insolence is unprecedented, but the Greeks have widespread support among the Kafirs, who have the outrageous idea that our [Root.GovernmentName] is in a state of decline. Behind our backs they mock us as 'the sick man of Europe'."
 peoples_spring.11.a: "We must accept this"
 peoples_spring.11.b: "We'll show them a 'sick man'..."
 peoples_spring.12.t: "Greece Calls for Aid"
 peoples_spring.12.d: "The newly-established Greek [GRE.Monarch.GetTitle] [GRE.Monarch.GetName] has called upon the powers of Europe to proclaim their support for the Greek state in the face of Ottoman aggression. Due to the popularity of the Philhellene movement among Western poets and painters this appeal has wide public support, especially after a French painter named Eugène Delacroix made a widely-reproduced dramatization of a recent Turkish massacre of Greek civilians.\nIf we do not step in to assist the Greeks, the Ottomans may soon move back in to re-annex their state once the public eye has moved elsewhere."

The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must bring these issues under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] control in order to prevent a permanent collapse of the Caliphate.\nSome of our viziers regard this as a divine trial to challenge our Caliphate. However, this allegation should be treated with caution as this catastrophe was rather precipitated by our own mismanagement."

 great_fitna.2.t: "Sacking Of The Treasuries"

 great_fitna.2.b: "This disobedience must be punished."
 great_fitna.3.t: "Corruption At Court"
 great_fitna.3.d: "The court officials increasingly work against each other instead of trying to master the unfortunate circumstances of our Caliphate together. Extortion, violent crimes and assassinations are regularly shocking the state and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], inhibiting us significantly in our actions."

 great_fitna.6.d: "[HED.Monarch.GetName] [HED.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], [HED.Monarch.GetTitle] of [HED.GetName], is considered the guardian of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, who has ruled under our wings for a long time. But with the diminishing influence we exert on this region, [HED.Monarch.GetSheHe] was no longer able to stop Sunni preachers and missionaries from evangelizing in [HED.Monarch.GetHerHis] realm.\nIf we were to lose the holiest sites of Islam, it would be a severe blow to our Caliphal authority.

 great_fitna.7.d: "It has come to our attention that our Levantine territories have not been as badly hit by the constant anarchy as other parts of the Caliphate. We owe this mainly to the governor of Damascus, the Armenian general Badr al-Jamali. He kept rebellious troops in check and rationed supplies to the civilian population.\nTruly, this man is one of the most capable people who have sworn allegiance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We could now request his assistance in order to pacify the other parts of the Caliphate as well. However, we should also be aware that he could exploit our weakness for personal gain."

 great_fitna.8.t: "The Ominous Banquet"
 great_fitna.8.d: "We had not expected Badr al-Jamali to take such a tough approach:\nOn the very same day that he arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], he invited all commanders of the rebellious Mamluks of the city to a banquet. Since they did not know the reason for the visit of the Armenian general, they did not suspect him of ill intentions upon his arrival. When they set off drunk one after another at late hours, they were individually strangled by al-Jamali's men.\nNow that we have regained control of the capital for the time being, al-Jamali demands the position as supreme vizier. He promises to eliminate remaining rebels and pacify the country so that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will eventually regain full control of the Caliphate. Do we want to get involved in his effective but cruel schemes?"
 great_fitna.8.a: "Appoint him as the most empowered vizier."
 great_fitna.8.b: "He must be stopped before he becomes too powerful."
 great_fitna.9.t: "Army Dissension"
 great_fitna.9.d: "Reports of violent clashes within our army are becoming increasingly frequent - especially between Turkish mamluks and Nubian, Berber or Syrian soldiers on the other. This was made clear when [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], while walking through [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], had to watch with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own eyes how a drunken mamluk was murdered by a Nubian mob after he had attacked a Nubian soldier.\nWe must finally choose one of the two sides in order not to have both groups as our enemy, but at the same time we must prevent ourselves from becoming the puppet of one of the factions!"

 great_fitna.11.b: "Make them come to their senses."
 great_fitna.12.t: "Autonomous Governors"
 great_fitna.12.d: "The crumbling authority of the Caliphate has led to a desire for greater self-rule in many parts of our empire. The wealthy coastal towns of the Levant are particularly affected, where the local merchant aristocracy regularly suspends tax payments to us. Supposedly they are striving to shake off our suzerainty completely in order to be able to trade and accumulate riches peacefully."

 great_fitna.102.d: "Earlier today, an audacious event unfolded as the grand palace of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] succumbed to the onslaught of rebellious Mamluk commanders. With the connivance of treacherous viziers, they coerced the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to relinquish [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] reign, exiling [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] from the very land [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] once ruled.\n In [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stead, they elevated a feeble and inexperienced figurehead to the throne, a mere pawn in their grand scheme. Although the insurgents presently cease hostilities, this perilous coup shall inflict unparalleled harm upon the Caliphate, rendering it feeble and vulnerable like never before. The aftermath is poised to plunge the realm into uncertainty, breeding further discord and instability."
