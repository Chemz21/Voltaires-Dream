 string_start_title_iberia_1054: "1054 Overview: Iberia"
 string_start_region_iberia_1054: "While the Great Schism looks to be severing the eastern and western Churches, a struggle of a different character is being fought on the arid plains and mountains of Iberia.\n\nEver since the Islamic §YUmayyad§! conquest of Iberia in the 8th century the Christian inhabitants in the north have fought back and defied attempts to subjugate them, gradually eroding the Caliphate’s grip on the continent. But despite the efforts of the Reconquista, only five decades ago the Caliphate of §YCórdoba§!, the unquestioned rulers of §YAl-Andalus§!, was united and prosperous. Córdoba itself could be called the largest city in all of Europe and was a beacon of the Islamic world as well as a melting pot of religions and cultures.\n\nBut the cracks began to appear as a ruinous civil war engulfed the caliphate starting in 1009 between feuding brothers, a power struggle from which it would never recover. The once mighty caliphate is now a shadow of its former self in 1054, reduced to a republican state with the rest divided among competing taifas. But there may yet be hope for the ambitions of caliphs in centuries past to be fulfilled; it is only the question of who will seize the opportunity and if they can survive the looming threat to the north.\n\nMeanwhile, the Christian kingdoms of Iberia are numerous but committed to the cause of liberating the south. The kingdom of §YLeón§!, the most prominent, has recently united §YGalicia§! and §YCastile§! under the rule of its king §YFernando I§!, posing a significant threat to the bordering taifas. As a result of constant warfare the borderlands have become a depopulated no man’s land, though the hotly contested border in the west is checked by the march of §YPortucale§!. Even gold is playing an increasingly important role as the north uses its influence to demand payments (parias) from the weaker taifas.\n\nIn the east the kingdom of §YNavarra§! is in a precarious situation. Disagreements with their Leónese neighbors may prove problematic in the near future as the kingdom struggles to reverse its ongoing decline. And the kingdom of §YAragon§!, though small may become a powerful player on the continent if it can acquire a stake in the Reconquista. The county of §YBarcelona§!, along with the other polities of §YCatalonia§!, are now independent from the French crown in all but name as the task is left to them to drive out the Islamic presence from the region."
 string_start_title_france_1054: "1054 Overview: France"
 string_start_region_france_1054: "High Middle Ages §YFrance§!: a prosperous, united kingdom with unrivalled power and influence, the cradle of Western Europe. Or so it would seem on an ordinary map.\n\nThe reality of France in 1054 is one of fragmentation and division, far from the glory days of §YCharlemagne§!’s empire in the 9th century. Though the §YCapet§! dynasty based in §YParis§! claims de jure authority over the whole of the kingdom, the fiefs of the realm are often distanced from affairs in the capital and their loyalties are largely symbolic. Many powerful vassals such as those of §YNormandy§!, §YChampagne§! and §YToulouse§! act more or less independently of the king, facilitated by cultural and linguistic divides. Some such as the dukes of §YBrittany§! and §YFlanders§! are merely vassals in name and refuse to respect the king's authority.\n\nBut all across the realm, signs of change are on the horizon. Brittany is beset by a fierce dynastic conflict, one that could determine the nation's course. Meanwhile, the Norman duke §YGuillaume I§! consolidates his power, having thwarted recent French and §YAngevin§! invasions; now being an unlikely candidate for the §YEnglish§! throne, he schemes to seize it whether through peaceful or hostile means, but not without opposition from the English themselves and rival claimants as far afield as §YNorway§!. Furthermore, large duchies that were once dominant, such as §YAquitaine§!, have begun to fracture into smaller states as lesser lords carve out local lands for themselves.\n\nThe winds of change are also reverberating throughout society. Communes have begun to develop in the already expanding and prospering market towns, and fundamental changes in the principles of feudalism are reshaping the political landscape. In the absence of strong central authority, powerful magnates are rapidly rising to prominence, many of which may in the future seek glory outside the kingdom’s borders. But for now, it remains to be seen who will take advantage of these developments.\n\nDespite the significant challenges facing the French king §YHenri I§! from all sides, a succession of strong monarchs may yet be able to extend their royal demesne outside Paris and bring the defiant vassals to heel. But to ultimately succeed they must manoeuver between external dangers, the most pressing being the §YHoly Roman Empire§! to the east, while also curtailing the power of the lords within their borders. Diplomacy, war and the complexities of feudalism must all play to their advantage in this struggle; France’s fate lies in their hands…"
 string_start_title_britain_1054: "1054 Overview: British Isles"
 string_start_region_britain_1054: "The mysterious isles up north, though relatively isolated from events on the mainland, have nonetheless been thrust into strife and uncertainty over their future.\n\nIn 1054 the Anglo-Saxon kingdom is finally prospering again under their king §YEadweard the Confessor§!. With a strong economy through exports of wool to the continent, §YEnglalonde§! is one of the wealthiest states in Europe. However, the legacy of the §YViking§! invasion of England just four decades before is still fresh in memory. The §YDanish§! king §YCnut§! successfully subjugated the kingdom in 1015 in his quest to forge a North Sea empire, but his successors were unable to hold onto it after 1042. Regardless, those of Danish descent now constitute a majority of the population in the northern §YDanelaw§!, a region unwilling to abide by laws imposed from the south.\n\nBut Eadweard himself is aging and has still not yet produced an heir to succeed him as rival claimants, particularly Earl §YHereweald§! of §YWessex§! and King §YHarald§! of §YNorway§!, prepare to make the first move for the throne. Additionally there are even rumours that Edward has promised the throne to Duke §YGuillaume I§! of §YNormandy§! should he die without issue, which if true could alter the course of English history. Meanwhile, further north the Anglo-Danish Earl §YSiward§! of §YNorthumbria§! has taken up arms against the kingdom of §YAlba§! to depose the tyrant king §YMacbeth§! once and for all.\n\nElsewhere, the §YWelsh§! princes have thus far been able to distance themselves from affairs in London, but should England’s ambivalent relations with them worsen their subjugation may be all but inevitable. However, the efforts of the ambitious §YGruffydd ap Llywelyn§! of §YGwynedd§! and §YPowys§! to unite Wales under one banner may reverse their fortunes and perhaps allow them to drive back the Germanic yoke.\n\nIn §YIreland§! the era of High Kings claiming supremacy over the entire island looks to be over with the death of the last unanimously acknowledged High King, §YBrian Boru§!, at the battle of Clontarf in 1014. In the aftermath, Ireland has remained divided among regional dynasties albeit with the influence of the Norse invaders, by now reduced to a few small holdings on the coast, permanently broken as a result of the battle. Only time will tell whether the decades-long interregnum will finally come to an end and who among the patchwork of feuding clans will triumph."
 string_start_title_scandinavia_1054: "1054 Overview: Scandinavia"
 string_start_region_scandinavia_1054: "In 1054, Scandinavia is at a crossroads: while the Viking Age is in decline as paganism and the culture of raiding and seafaring are gradually phased out, the influence of old Norse ways is still tangible.\n\nEver since the century prior, Roman Catholicism has slowly but surely taken root in many of the kingdoms that once revered Odin, Thor and Freya. First came §YDenmark§!, whose ruler §YHarald Bluetooth§! converted to Christianity in the late 10th century, and then the efforts of §YOlaf Tryggvason§! in §YNorway§! who led an aggressive campaign of converting the country. However, in §YSweden§! these same efforts have had a mixed legacy as a significant part of the country still clings on to its old beliefs, and it is unclear whether the kingdom will join its neighbors or firmly follow its own path.\n\nIn Norway, under §YHarald ‘Hardråde’§! the realm is finally at peace after clashes with Denmark have died down. These conflicts led to a disastrous defeat at the naval battle of Svolder in 1000 and the Danish king §YSvend Forkbeard§! becoming king of Norway. A Christian Norwegian, §YOlaf Haraldsson§!, managed to regain the throne but was killed at the battle of Stiklestad in 1030; Norway then became part of the Dane §YCnut the Great§!’s domain until 1035. But this peace may not last long as tensions over who will succeed King §YEadweard§! of §YEnglalonde§! reaches breaking point and Harald, determined to press his dubious claim to the throne, waits to make his move.\n\nSweden under the reign of §YEmund the Old§! will have to contend with its deep religious divisions amid an ongoing dispute with the Archbishopric of §YBremen§!, while also ensuring that a king does not rule both Norway and Denmark for fear of being surrounded. With the unification of both the Swedes and the §YGeats§! under one realm, however, they may be poised to challenge their neighbors in the future. They are also well placed to expand east across the Baltic as the western trade routes become less lucrative.\n\nIn the meantime, Denmark has only recently split from a short period of Norwegian rule after the sudden death of §YMagnus the Good§! in 1047. Now under §YSvend II§!, Denmark must decide whether to restore its former dominance in Scandinavia and England or protect itself from outside threats. Meanwhile, the last Norse-Gaelic holdouts in the British Isles must contend with the decline of the Viking Age and establish closer links to the islands lest they be driven out entirely."

 string_start_title_germany_1054: "1054 Overview: Holy Roman Empire"
 string_start_region_germany_1054: "The §YHoly Roman Empire§! is undoubtedly one of the most powerful entities in Europe in 1054. Divided into hundreds of autonomous counties and duchies, the Emperor, King of §YGermany§!, §YBurgundy§! and §YItaly§!, rules over many different peoples of the continent.\n\nAfter the extinction of the §YLiudolfingers§! in 1024, Count §YConrad II§! of §YWorms§! was elected Emperor, member of the §YSalier§! dynasty, who has ruled the Empire ever since. Through the promotion of imperial secular and ecclesiastical institutions, such as the construction of the Cathedral of §YSpeyer§!, hitherto the largest existing cathedral, the Emperor's political position was greatly solidified and expanded. Although many princes dislike the Emperor's growing power, clever moves on the board of power have made it possible to avoid major conspiracies and rebellions so far...\n\nThe Duchy of §YSaxony§!, located in the north of Germany, which is ruled by the house of §YBillung§!, has frequently opposed the Emperors in the past, who might revolt again under a weak Emperor, trying to influence the surrounding counties. But also the south, the Duchies of §YSwabia§! and §YBavaria§! play an important role in the imperial politics, whereby the latter is currently experiencing a phase of instability, after the former Duke §YConrad I von Welf§! was deposed by Emperor §YHenry III§! because of his disloyalty. Swabia's dukes, however, have always appeared as loyal allies of the Emperor, receiving several counties and cities as imperial donations. The Duchy of §YBohemia§!, the only §YSlavic§! territory in the Empire, has been weakened in recent years by conflicts with the §YPolish§! Crown and the Emperor but could turn out to be a dangerous enemy for them if the Duke is able to consolidate his domain.\n\nThe Empire borders on Slavic tribal territory in the north, which is ruled by heathen tribesmen. The subjugation of these region has turned out to be difficult in the past, as its inhabitants have persistently defended themselves against their conquerors, thus repulsing them again. The counts and dukes close to the border will still attempt to subjugate the tribes permanently in order to obtain new land for settlement. However, not only the Holy Roman Emperor hast cast an eye on these areas, but also the Kings of §YDenmark§! and Poland.\n\nTechnically, all Imperial Princes have the potential to become the next Emperor, but only time will tell which dynasty will obtain the approval of the Electors and be able to kick the Salians off the Imperial Throne in the end."
 string_start_title_italy_1054: "1054 Overview: Italy"
 string_start_region_italy_1054: "The northern half of §YItaly§! is part of the §YHoly Roman Empire§! and is mainly ruled by small counties and bishoprics, while the §YByzantine Empire§! clings to its last Italian fortresses in the south.\n\nThe merchant republics of §YPisa§!, §YVenice§! and §YGenoa§! have focused on trade and navy and will eventually compete against each other for trading dominance in Italy and the Mediterranean Sea. The Margraviate of §YTuscany§! is formed around the most fertile region of Italy, with the wealthy capital of §YFlorence§!, providing its rulers with lavish treasuries. Under the young but talented heiress §YMatilde Attoning§!, it might ascend to a Grand Duchy – or collapse as a result of succession conflicts.\n\n§YRome§!, the Holiest City of Christianity next to Jerusalem, is ruled by the §YPapal States§!, whose influence extends beyond the city to the Adriatic coast, but is also subject to the Holy Roman Emperor itself. Thanks to the Emperor's help, the Papacy was liberated from the grips of Roman aristocracy in 1046, which allowed the Popes to initiate reforms of the Catholic Church, gradually strengthening the Pope's position. Pope §YVictor II§! and his successors will certainly not deviate from this course, trying to make the Papacy the most influential authority in the Catholic World...\n\nIn southern Italy, the Byzantine Empire is attempting to defend its last possessions against an alliance of §YLombards§! and §YNormans§! for years now, who were originally hired as mercenaries as support against Saracen pirates. Thanks to their past victories, the Norman house of §YHauteville§! has  acquired a considerable territory for themselves and was appointed 'Duke of §YApulia§! and §YCalabria§!' by the Pope. After the Greeks have been expelled from Italy altogether, the Normans will certainly try to expand their territory even further.\n\nBecause of their wealth, the islands of §YCorsica§! and §YSardinia§! are frequently targeted by Saracen pirates, but over time they have learned to defend themselves against them. However, due to their central location in the Mediterranean Sea, they might serve as potential trading colonies for the trade republics of Pisa, Genoa and §YAmalfi§!. Therefore, they should beware of invasion attempts from the mainland in the future.\n\nAfter the collapse of Byzantine rule in the 9th century, the §YFatimids§! took over §YSicily§!, who have already lost control of the island however, that is now ruled by warring Muslim qadits. Without a strong emir or sultan to unite them, they are easy prey for §YIfrîqiya§! or their Christian neighbors."
 string_start_title_balkans_1054: "1054 Overview: Balkans"
 string_start_region_balkans_1054: "The §YBalkans§! are inhabited by peoples of different cultures and religions, all striving for supremacy in the region.\n\nAbove all, the §YByzantine Empire§! is dominating the south of the Balkans, which has been politically isolated since the Great Schism. Despite the Macedonian Renaissance in the early 11th century, the Empire is once again facing a severe depression. The subjugation of §YBulgaria§! and §YArmenia§!, as well as being unable to manage the administration of all territories are still overextending the Empire to this day. Besides, the antiquated and fragile military structures make it difficult to defend the last Byzantine possessions in southern Italy against §YApulia§! or Anatolia against §YSeljuk§! warlords.\n\nAt the same time, an internal crisis looms in the Grand Palace of §YConstantinople§! itself. After the death of Empress Zoe, her husband §YConstantine IX§! rules as a decadent autocrat who – along with his sister-in-law Theodora – belongs to the last living member of the §YMacedonian§! dynasty. The question about his successor will surely cause the different factions of the government to oppose each other who all want to raise their own candidates to the throne.\n\nThe §YPannonian Basin§! is controlled by the rather young Kingdom of §YHungary§!, whose first King §YStephen I§! was crowned by the Pope in 1000. Thus, Catholicism has only been the state religion in Hungary for a few years now, which is why there are still few adherents of Tengrism in the kingdom. The eastern part is governed by the Principality of §YTransylvania§!, which is de facto part of Hungary but enjoys a high degree of autonomy, which it may have to defend by military force eventually. Likewise, a succession crisis is imminent when King §YAndreas I§! will try to assert his son Solomon's claim against his brother Béla as his successor.\n\nFurther south, there are the Slavic kingdoms of §YCroatia§! and §YBosnia§!, as well as the Principality of §YRashka§!, of which the latter will certainly attempt to liberate the Serbs within the next years, who are still under Byzantine rule. But also the Bulgarians who were subdued in 1018 are eager to fight for their independence against Byzantium if the time is ripe.\n\nThe §YAdriatic Sea§! is important for trade between East and West and was recently liberated from piracy by §YVenice§! who will try to expand its own influence in the sea, likely resulting in conflicts with local landowners, most notably §YRagusa§!.\n\nThe future of the Balkans depends heavily on Byzantium: if they cannot surmount domestic political crises, they will sooner or later disintegrate, allowing other nations to become the dominant power of the region in the emerging power vacuum."
 string_start_title_africa_1054: "1054 Overview: North Africa"
 string_start_region_africa_1054: "In 1054, North Africa experiences the aftermath of the ongoing decline of the §YFatimid Empire§!, resulting in struggles between rival governors in many places.\n\nThe Fatimids have resided in §YCairo§! since 969, whose Empire once stretched from §YTunisia§! to §YYemen§!, which has shrunk due to excessive self-governance in the outer territories to §YEgypt§! and the §YLevant§! until today. Despite a policy of tolerance, there has been increasing tensions between the various ethnic groups in the Caliphate in recent years, which could potentially tear the multi-ethnic nation apart from the inside, leaving the Empire vulnerable to rebellion and invasion...\n\nTo the west, the §YZirids§! rule the Sultanate of §YIfrîqiya§!, originally established by the Fatimids to govern their western territories, but they failed to do so, and §YSicily§! and §YAlgeria§! broke out of the Empire in the early 11th century. Even Ifrîqiya belongs only de jure to the Fatimid Empire and has been operating completely independently for a long time, which has led to prosperity in the state however. But in 1048, the Fatimids started one last desperate attempt to reintegrate Ifrîqiya by having Bedouin tribes devastate it and take control of §YTripolitania§! and §YDjerid§!.\n\nSince the Fatimid intervention in §YMorocco§! in the 10th century, it has been fragmented into several emirates, fighting for supremacy over Morocco altogether ever since. They seem to neglect the threat from the South, where the Berber §YDraa§! Confederation has called for an armed Jihad against heretics and heathen. The surrounding tribes have already been subjugated recently, and it is only a matter of time before they cross the §YAtlas Mountains§! and invade Morocco...\n\nUndoubtedly, North Africa is on the verge of a political change of power, which will also bring about changes on the religious and cultural level of the continent."
