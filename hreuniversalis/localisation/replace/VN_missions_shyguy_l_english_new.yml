 vn_flavor_kie.1.t: "The Patriarchate of Kiev"
 vn_flavor_kie.1.d: "Ever since Grand Prince Vladimir the Great converted the Kievan Rus to Christianity in 988, the fate of the Patriarchate of Kiev has remained a significant concern within our religious community. Our strong alliance with Byzantium has provided us with stability and support thus far. However, within our nation, there are individuals advocating for the establishment of an autoclephalic Patriarchate, aiming to assert our independence from Constantinople in ecclesiastical affairs.\nHow should we deal with this question?"
 vn_flavor_kie.1.a: "We will follow our own path."
 vn_flavor_kie.1.b: "Byzantium will remain to guide us."
 vn_flavor_kie.2.t: "A Steadfast Defender"
 vn_flavor_kie.2.d: "In our hour of need against our deadly foes, one man rose to the challenge of defending our capital and saving our dynasty from perishing in the books of history. Igor Svyatoslavich, a humble officer in our military court, took charge of the defensive line around our capital and repelled droves of enemies for weeks, till reinforcements arrived."
 vn_flavor_kie.2.a: "He is due for a promotion."
 vn_flavor_kie.2.b: "His tactics shall be studied by our future commanders."
 vn_flavor_kie.2.c: "Elevate his legend in the books of our history."
 vn_flavor_kie.3.t: "The Yaroslavichi Triumvirate"
 vn_flavor_kie.3.d: "Following the will of their father Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince Izyaslav of Kiev formed a triumvirate with his two brothers, Svyatoslav of Chernigov and Vsevolod of Pereyaslav, to rule the Kievan Rus in unison. Together they lead their forces into battle against bitter enemies such as the nomadic Oghuz Turks and their distant relative, Prince Vseslav of Polotsk.\n\nThis brotherly alliance, forged by loyalty and respect, will strengthen the unity of the Kievan Rus for years to come."
 vn_flavor_kie.3.a: "Fraternity is safe for the moment!"
 vn_flavor_kie.4.t: "The Polish-Kievan Alliance"
 vn_flavor_kie.4.d: "The Kievan Rus has always enjoyed an ambivalent relationship with Poland. While some in our [Root.GovernmentName] favor a closer alliance with the Poles to strengthen our position in the region, others are skeptical of too close ties with our neighbor to the west.\n\nHowever, given the current political situation and to strengthen the friendship between our nations, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is considering sending a distinguished delegation to [polish_ally.Monarch.GetTitle] [polish_ally.Monarch.GetName] of [polish_ally.GetName]. This mission could strengthen our diplomatic relations and potentially lead to benefits in trade, military support, or dynastic ties. Should we undertake this diplomatic mission?"
 vn_flavor_kie.4.a: "Send the delegation to strengthen our alliance with [polish_ally.GetName]."
 vn_flavor_kie.4.b: "The Poles cannot be trusted, we keep the status quo."
 vn_flavor_kie.5.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective]-[From.GetAdjective] Alliance"
 vn_flavor_kie.5.d: "A delegation from [From.GetName] has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] and is cordially greeted by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The representatives of both rulers are invited to a ceremonial banquet, where they have the opportunity to get to know each other better and discuss the possibilities of closer cooperation.\n\nWhile [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] hopes to benefit from such an alliance in trade, military support and dynastic ties, we too could benefit from it to some extent. Should we agree to closer cooperation with the Kievan Rus and lay the foundation for a promising alliance, or should we take a more cautious stance to avoid possible risks?"
 vn_flavor_kie.5.a: "We agree to closer cooperation with [From.GetName]."
 vn_flavor_kie.5.b: "This proposal conflicts with our diplomatic focus."
 vn_flavor_kie.6.t: "Response from [From.GetName]"
 vn_flavor_kie.6.d: "Our delegation returns from [From.GetName] with pleasant news: It has been officially announced that [From.GetName] has agreed to our proposal of closer cooperation. The [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle] recognizes the strategic importance of an alliance with [Root.GetName] and is ready to lay the foundation for a deep partnership."
 vn_flavor_kie.6.a: "Relieving."
 vn_flavor_kie.7.t: "Response from [From.GetName]"
 vn_flavor_kie.7.d: "After the return of our delegation from [From.GetName], word reaches the [Root.GetTitle] that the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has rejected the proposal of closer cooperation. [From.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] argues that the risks of such a cooperation outweighed the benefits and that [From.GetName] currently has other priorities."
 vn_flavor_kie.7.a: "Disappointing."
 vn_flavor_kie.8.t: "Ruthenian Imperial Ambitions"
 vn_flavor_kie.8.d: "In the past, the Kievan Rus was fragmented into dozens of Principalities, ruled by different branches of the Rurikids, who often fought against each other for fame and territory. However, thanks to the wise rule of our Princely family, we were able to end this time of splintering and subjugate the other Principalities.\n\nWith our prestige we have acquired, we are not worthy of a being a Principality, but that of a true Empire! It is only a question of what we will call our country from now on to express our extensive splendour."
 vn_flavor_kie.8.a: "We have always been known as the Kievan Rus!"
 vn_flavor_kie.8.b: "As the Great Rus, we will emphasize our greatness and heritage."
 vn_flavor_kie.8.c: "We shall be known as the Ruthenian Empire from now on."
 vn_flavor_kie.8.dd: "Adopt the name of our Scandinavian ancestors: Garðaríki."
 vn_flavor_kie.8.e: "Our current name is perfectly adequate."
