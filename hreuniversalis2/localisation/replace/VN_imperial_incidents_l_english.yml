 incident_investiture_controversy.1.t: "Pressure of the Pataria"
 incident_investiture_controversy.1.d: "With the beginning of ecclesiastical reform efforts by the papacy, the Pataria, a radical clerical movement motivated by these ideas, has acquired growing influence in Lombard dioceses and monasteries. In recent weeks, they have eliminated disagreeable priests and replaced them with clerics loyal to the Pope instead.\nPressed into distress by this political opposition, Archbishop Guido of Milan has urgently decided to send the episcopal vestments back to the Emperor and retire as a monk to a secluded monastery. Before a new bishop was able to be elected, the Pataria seized the power of the bishopric and appointed a new archbishop themselves!"
 incident_investiture_controversy.1.a: "This shall not be our fight."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.t: "The Investiture Controversy"
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.d: "Starting in the late 1050s, relations between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire became incredibly strained. The main conflict was between whether the Monarch or the Pope should have the right to appoint local bishops within their demesne.\nWith the election of [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] to the Holy See, an embittered opponent of the Empire was appointed head of the Church. Influenced by religious zeal and the conviction of supremacy of the papacy, this man will try to restore the freedom of the Church in face of the Empire."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.a: "It is time to demonstrate the superiority of the Emperor."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.tt: "The Investiture Controversy can be immediately ended by the Emperor if he attains §Y75%§! warscore in a war against the Papal States using the '§YImperial Supremacy§!' casus belli.\n§RMeanwhile, the Emperor will suffer from reduced legitimacy, diplomatic reputation and papal influence.§!"
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.b: "The Pope shall be the supreme ecclesiastical head of the Empire."

 incident_investiture_controversy.2.c: "A fair compromise must be sought."
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.t: "The Two Swords"
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.d: "In order to avert a fragmentation of the Imperial Church, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has declared all claims to spiritual supremacy of the Pope as invalid. He hopes to ward off the papal clutches over ecclesiastical matters of the Empire by doing so.\nThis is the beginning of a protracted conflict that will put Catholicism and its principles to the test."
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.d2: "Already Charlemagne knew that he needed not only the approval of his entourage but also of the Church to be legitimized as Frankish Emperor.\nIn order to prevent conflicts with the Popes, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has recognized the papacy as spiritual head of the Holy Roman Empire, which, as the representative of God, is supposed to still stand above the Emperors themselves."
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.d3: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] was able to circumvent the question of who was the legitimate spiritual head of the Holy Roman Empire by a clever compromise that granted the papacy some privileges without taking too much power away from himself. Nevertheless, these concessions will enable us to exercise our ambitions on the Empire."

He claims the Emperor has been removed from the Church because he denies papal supremacy by continuing to appoint new bishops within the Empire. The Pope has also declared that the princes of the Empire are no longer vassals under the Emperor!\nIt has been made clear to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that to escape the damning fate of excommunication, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will have to make a humiliating trek to Canossa – the current residence of [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] – as a gesture of peace to beg for forgiveness. Should we bow to the demands of the Pope and undertake such an embarrassing escapade?"

Barefoot and only wearing a hair-shirt, the traditional garb of monks, [Emperor.Monarch.GetSheHe] asks for admission to the palace.\nApparently the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] regrets [Emperor.Monarch.GetHerHis] recklessness in challenging the papal authority, but it might only be a vile ruse to lift [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] excommunication."

#Mediatization
 incident_mediatization: "Holy Roman Mediatization"
 incident_mediatization.1.t: "The Question of Mediatization"
 incident_mediatization.1.d: "The Holy Roman Empire has always been much less a centralized state than it has been a conglomeration of Prince-Bishoprics, Free Cities, Principalities, Duchies and Kingdoms alike. Due to the progressive reduction of imperial authority over the preceding centuries, the Theocracies and Free Cities have more or less been allowed to thrive despite a number of conflicts with the more expansionist monarchical states, and have retained their ancient privileges dating back hundreds of years while refusing to accept integration.\n\nHowever, radical changes to the Empire's structure are on the horizon, and ones largely of our own making. As we have expanded further and further into the Empire's borders, the question of how to compensate the dispossessed secular rulers of territory we have seized has become increasingly pressing. Giving the lands back and thereby compromising ourselves would be unacceptable to us; therefore, we must convince the Emperor that secularization of all Theocracies and mediatization of all Free Cities is the only option to preserve the Empire."

 incident_mediatization.1.a.tt: "All Free Cities and Theocracies in the HRE are informed of their fate"
 incident_mediatization.1.b: "Back down"

 incident_mediatization.2.da: "As a Theocracy, our position in the Holy Roman Empire has been very tenuous as of late due to our conflicts with the secular states seeking to annex our lands. Our saving grace, however, has been the lavish privileges conferred on us by the Emperors in centuries past guaranteeing our rights. Yet now, our whole territorial integrity looks to be undone with outrageous demands from [From.GetName] being pushed on the Emperor to secularize all Theocracies in the Empire!"

Our saving grace, however, has been the lavish privileges conferred on us by the Emperors in centuries past guaranteeing our rights. Yet now, our whole territorial integrity looks to be undone with outrageous demands from [From.GetName] being pushed on the Emperor to mediatize all Free Cities in the Empire!"
 incident_mediatization.2.a: "We must take a stand against this, lest we perish!"
 incident_mediatization.3.t: "Holy Roman Mediatization"
 incident_mediatization.3.d: "The Emperor has failed to stop the expansionist ambitions of foreign states, whose conquests have deprived many former secular states of their lands. Now, a delegation from [med_demander.GetName] has sent harsh demands to the Emperor, demanding that the Theocracies and Free Cities of the Empire be completely abolished and annexed to the dispossessed secular princes as compensation."
 incident_mediatization.3.a: "Heed their demands for the good of the Empire."
 incident_mediatization.3.a.tt: "All Theocracies and Free Cities in the Empire lose §R-50§! opinion about the Emperor, while all Monarchies in the Empire gain §G50§! opinion about the Emperor.\nThe §YHoly Roman Mediatization§! will begin, causing all Free Cities and Theocracies to be progressively partitioned among the Monarchies."
 incident_mediatization.3.b: "Teach them to not meddle in Imperial affairs."

 incident_mediatization.4.d: "The Holy Roman Mediatization has begun, and the worst of our fears have finally been realized as more surrounding Theocracies are dismembered and abolished by the day. The complete partition and annexation of our lands to neighboring secular states is practically a certainty, unless we choose to fight back or find some other way to convince the Emperor that we are worth saving."

 incident_hohenstaufer_inheritance.1.d: "A recent battle on the Elster has left [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] mortally wounded causing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death last night in Merseburg. The lack of a proper heir has launched a succession crisis in [Root.GetName]. It is now up to the Emperor to recognize the interim successor or replace him with a more appropriate person."

 incident_hohenstaufer_inheritance.1.tt: "The Emperor will decide on the Swabian succession and may depose our new ruler."
 incident_hohenstaufer_inheritance.2.t: "The Swabian Succession"
 incident_hohenstaufer_inheritance.2.d: "The former Swabian duke has tragically been killed in battle and has left no appropriate heir. As a result, the ducal title has been returned to the Empire to be redistributed by the Emperor. It is now up to him to either recognize the weak claimant [WWS.Monarch.GetName] [WWS.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] as new duke of Swabia or to bestow it on a stronger nobleman who should receive and lead this important dukedom instead."

 incident_hohenstaufer_inheritance.3.t: "The Swabian Succession"
 incident_hohenstaufer_inheritance.3.d: "The Swabian dukes have been one of the most influential princes in the Empire for several decades now. This fact allowed us to gain wealth and prestige when former Emperors bought our loyalty with generous donations. It is therefore not surprising that [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] was confirmed as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Swabia by the Emperor, who certainly hopes to win [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as an ally in [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] future endeavours."
 incident_hohenstaufer_inheritance.3.d2: "The Emperor annulled the title from our ruler and ceded it to one of his own dynastic relatives! This is obviously a vile attempt to weaken our influence on imperial politics and even to take over our nation with all its estates and wealth. We must prevent our nation from falling entirely into the lap of the Emperor."
 incident_hohenstaufer_inheritance.3.d3: "As close friends of the Emperor, it was just in time for them when the former Swabian ruler passed away and the opportunity arose to reassign the ducal title. Consequently, the emperor jumped at the chance and declared Duke Friedrich to be deposed, enfeoffing the Hohenstaufers with the Swabian duchy instead."
