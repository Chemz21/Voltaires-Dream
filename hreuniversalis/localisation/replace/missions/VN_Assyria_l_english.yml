 vn_flavor_asy.100.t: "King of the Universe"
 vn_flavor_asy.100.d: "After years of strategic conquests and diplomatic maneuvers, our nation has successfully reclaimed the vast territories once held by the ancient Assyrian Empire. This monumental achievement echoes the legacy of rulers like Sargon of Akkad and Sargon II, who bore the esteemed title 'King of the Universe'. By restoring the Empire's former glory, we not only honor our ancestors but also assert our dominance on the world stage."
 vn_flavor_asy.100.a: "We are the masters of Mesopotamia and beyond!"
 vn_flavor_asy.101.t: "The Church of the East"
 vn_flavor_asy.101.d: "After the Church of the East had detached itself from the 'Great Church' in the 4th century due to religious disagreements, it quickly transformed into the patron of the Christians of Mesopotamia. The Sassanid rulers promoted the Church of the East in order to maintain the loyalty of their Christian subjects and to create a contrast with the hostile Byzantine Empire. The power of the Church of the East did not begin to fade even after the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century, when missionaries were spreading the Nestorian faith to India and even China.\nWith the conquest of [6301.GetName], we can finally libertate the seat of the Patriarch of the Church of the East from heathen authorities."
 vn_flavor_asy.101.a: "This represents a remarkable resurgence of the Nestorian faith!"
 vn_flavor_asy.103.t: "The Bureaucracy of the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName]"
 vn_flavor_asy.103.d: "In ancient times, the eunuchs of the Assyrian Empire played a pivotal role in the administration of both the court and the military. Trusted for their loyalty and dedication, they rose to dominate some of the highest offices in the Empire.\nNow, voices at court suggest that reviving this practice could strengthen the stability of our government. By appointing eunuchs to key positions, we may secure a loyal and effective bureaucracy once more. The only question is how much we want to empower the eunuchs."
 vn_flavor_asy.103.a: "Institutionalize the Eunuchs."
 vn_flavor_asy.103.b: "Install them as governors again."
 vn_flavor_asy.103.c: "We do not need their help."
 vn_flavor_asy.104.t: "Remembering the Urartian Empire"
 vn_flavor_asy.104.d: "The Urartian Empire once dominated today's Armenia beginning in the 9th century BC, before it was destroyed by Cyrus the Great in the 6th century BC, thus becoming part of Persia. In the intervening period, Urartu was a bitter enemy of the Assyrian Empire and numerous wars were waged against Urartu. In 714 BC, a great campaign by King Sargon II briefly turned Urartu into a vassal of Assyria, until it regained its independence after his death.\n\nNow that we have once again conquered the region around Lake Van, the question arises as to how we deal with the subjugated Armenians. Over 1,000 years ago, we were sworn enemies, but today we share a similar fate, threatened by Muslim conquerors around us."
 vn_flavor_asy.104.a: "We will reconcile with the Armenian people."
 vn_flavor_asy.104.b: "Celebrate our conquest like our ancestors did before us!"
 vn_flavor_asy.104.tt: "Every owned province of §YArmenian§! culture will receive:"
