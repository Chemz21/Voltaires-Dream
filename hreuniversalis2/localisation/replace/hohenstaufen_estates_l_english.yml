 tribal_estate_events.6.t: "Our Kingdom is in disarray!"
 tribal_estate_events.6.d: "Keeping vassals loyal is never an easy task and right now we are living through some dire times. The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ could very likely help us stabilize the situation so that we can get back on our feet but we would be increasing their influence over our state."
 EST_VAL_TRIBES_STABILIY_BOOSTED: "Stabilized the Kingdom: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.t: "Tribes view the Kingdom as weak!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.d: "Our military leadership is inexperienced and weak. The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ are questioning if they can really support such green men in battle, offering instead to supply us with seasoned warriors ready to lead our troops."
 tribal_estate_events.7.b: "That worked oh so well for Rome."
 tribal_estate_events.8.t: "The Kingdom is not unified!"
 tribal_estate_events.8.d: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has proven [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] unable to keep the [Root.GetAdjective] realm unified and the $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ worry that we are becoming the object of ridicule. Prominent clan leaders have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] offering to strengthen our rule though some would say that relying on others to enforce this unity makes for an unstable peace."
 EST_VAL_TRIBES_UNITY: "Kingdom Unified: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 tribal_estate_events.9.t: "Adopt Tribal Methods!"
 tribal_estate_events.9.d: "One of the Clan Chiefs has come forward, as a spokesman for their group, and urges us to model our state after their old warrior societies, using the tactics that made them strong. 'Crush your enemies, drive them before you, and hear the lamentations of their women!'"
 tribal_estate_events.9.b: "That is barbarianism!"
 tribal_estate_events.11.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] after the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tribal_estate_events.11.d: "A distant cousin of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to gain the gratitude of the tribes. Many strong tribal leaders are now demanding that we change the future plans of succession to ensure that this cousin is guaranteed his rightful place as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Whether they are motivated by true loyalty to our kinsman or feel he could easily be influenced is hard to tell but they would certainly not take refusal to follow their advice very well."
 tribal_estate_events.12.t: "Tribes demand more men"
 tribal_estate_events.12.d: "Prominent Tribal leaders have approached us demanding that we let them make use of the state resources to defend their lands. They claim that neighboring states are making incursions and raids into the land they control and that the only efficient way to defend our borders is to put some of our troops directly under their command."

The Holy Orders aspire to be recognized as an estate of the same importance as the Nobility and will enlist their full political and religious sway to help a benevolent overlord."
