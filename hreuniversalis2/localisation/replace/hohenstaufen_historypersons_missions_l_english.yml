 vn_missions.200.t: "Coronation in Rome"
 vn_missions.200.d: "After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Charlemagne was the first Western European ruler to be crowned Emperor in 800, claiming the heritage of the Roman Emperors. With the coronation of Otto the Great, however, the Imperial Title has ceased to be in the hands of the once so great Carolingians. Instead, the German Kings have borne this coveted title, and have called themselves Holy Roman Emperors ever since.\nDue to our expansion into France, Lotharingia and Lombardy and the takeover of these regal titles, it is truly no longer adequate to call us a [Root.GovernmentName]. For this reason, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] travelled to Rome, where the Pope felt compelled to award [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] an Imperial Title. This will undoubtedly confirm our splendour, but it may cause an imbalance of power in Europe."
