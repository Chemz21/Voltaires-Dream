 vn_lor_crossroad_of_civilisations_desc: "Our state lies on the border between France and the Empire – meaning we are not only a cultural melting pot, but a flashpoint of tension. Appeasing both sides, while protecting our northern frontiers, will help us play each bloc against the other to our own advantage."
 vn_lor_control_waterways_title: "Control the Waterways"
 vn_lor_control_waterways_desc: "Meuse, Moselle, Saar and Rhine: we are lucky to live near four important rivers that help facilitate local industry and the lucrative south-north trade routes. We should take advantage of this, with the careful implementation of both tariffs and privileges."
 vn_lor_a_national_identity_title: "A National Identity"
 vn_lor_a_national_identity_desc: "Lorrainian culture is mainly aligned to the French, but there are German quarters in every town and as a part of the Empire we follow Germanic law codes instead of French ones. We should celebrate our diversity as a melting pot of Europe and a Franco-German hybrid."

 vn_lor_merge_ville_vieille_desc: "The city of Nancy is actually composed of two walled cities – the cobblestone old town (‘ville-vieille’), and the beautiful renaissance new town – next to one another. If we merge the old town with the new, and build a grand public square to connect them, Nancy shall truly become a jewel."
 vn_lor_reach_rhine_title: "Reach the Rhine"

 vn_lor_we_are_a_fortress_title: "We are a Fortress"
 vn_lor_we_are_a_fortress_desc: "By constructing additional forts in strategic locations, then linking them with a dedicated runner network, we can coordinate defences across the state. This will hopefully deter any attacks from those that covet our lands – God knows there are too many of them to count."
 vn_lor_expand_into_franconia_title: "Expand into Franconia"
 vn_lor_expand_into_franconia_desc: "Franconia, once the most powerful stem duchy of the Empire, has ceased to exist for hundreds of years except as a meaningless title for the Emperor’s favourite sycophants. Its southwestern corner lies across the Rhine, and is ripe for the taking."
 vn_lor_cleves_and_cologne_title: "Cleves and Cologne"
 vn_lor_cleves_and_cologne_desc: "We cannot let any rival state control both banks of the Rhine, at any point along the river’s main flow, as it presents a tactical and mercantile weakness on our part. For this, Cologne must come under our jurisdiction and ours alone."
 vn_lor_stabilise_duchy_title: "Stabilize the Duchy"

 vn_lor_imperial_capital_title: "Imperial Capital"
 vn_lor_imperial_capital_desc: "The throne of Charlemagne, the ‘Karlsthron’, continues to be used to crown the King of Germany.

 vn_lor_among_equals_desc: "Lotharingia was formed out of the reorganisation of Middle Francia in the mid-800s, containing the Frankish heartlands of Austrasia and the prestigious cities of Aachen, Metz and Pavia (each once an imperial capital). We are no longer servants to East or West Francia – we are among equals."

 vn_lor_lower_lorraine_title: "Lower Lorraine"
 vn_lor_lower_lorraine_desc: "The northern lowlands have always been de facto independent, as only the locals know how to navigate the maze of marshlands and not fall prey to deadly floods. Despite nature intending otherwise, the region is still highly developed, and it also holds the strategically important mouth of the Rhine."
 vn_lor_trois_eveches_title: "Trois-Évêchés"
 vn_lor_trois_eveches_desc: "The soft power that the ‘three bishoprics’ of Metz, Verdun and Toul hold in the area could be the key to order in the realm. Let’s make them work for us, directly or otherwise."
 vn_lor_ecclesiastical_relations_title: "Ecclesiastical Relations"

#Events
#BURGUNDY
 vn_missions.51.t: "The Inheritance of Flanders"
 vn_missions.51.d: "The ruler of the duchy of Flanders, [FLA.Monarch.GetName], is on [FLA.Monarch.GetHerHis] deathbed, rocked by a severe illness. In [FLA.Monarch.GetHerHis] final words uttered to the nobility stood around [FLA.Monarch.GetHerHim], [FLA.Monarch.GetSheHe] promises the duchy's possessions to the nearest claimant, which happens to be the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Burgundy through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] royal marriage with a member of the house of [FLA.Dynasty.GetName]. Moments later, [FLA.Monarch.GetName] breathes [FLA.Monarch.GetHerHis] last, and the duchy of Flanders is finally ours.\nWith Flanders under the Burgundian heel, the door to the Low Countries is open. We must seize the region and its boundless wealth if we are to gain the recognition of our duchy as more than a mere vassal by the European powers."
 vn_missions.51.a: "The history of Flanders shall now follow ours!"
 vn_missions.52.t: "A New Capital?"
 vn_missions.52.d: "The city of Arles was once one of the most important cities in southern France, being the seat of the kings of Arles, a kingdom created out of a merger of the former kingdoms of Lower and Upper Burgundy in 933. However, after the death of the nominal king of Arles, Rodolph III, in 1032 without issue, the kingdom passed to the Holy Roman Emperors, and it thus ceased to play a major political role. Several duchies broke away from the kingdom, such as Provence, Dauphine and even our own duchy in Burgundy. This has led to the rapid decline in power and prestige of the city.\nHowever, with Cisjurania, Transjurania, Provence and Burgundy now under our firm control, we can once again claim to be the rightful successors of the this historic kingdom. To celebrate the reunification of these territories, we should move the capital to its rightful place."
 vn_missions.52.a: "Arles, be the shining beacon of Burgundy once more."
 vn_missions.52.b: "I still quite like [Root.Capital.GetName], if you don't mind."
 vn_missions.53.t: "Coronation at Trier"
 vn_missions.53.d: "The crowning achievement of our efforts are finally upon us as [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] coronation in Trier as the first King of Burgundy in decades. And who else should be suited for this task of coronating our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] other than the Holy Roman Emperor? The event has sent shockwaves throughout Europe and will irrevocably alter the balance of power, now that a king with territory stretching from Amsterdam to Arles has been officially recognised by an emperor. We must waste no time in reaping the prestige and foreign praise this coronation has given us!"
 vn_missions.53.a: "Burgundy, resurgent once more!"
#NORMANDY
 vn_missions.54.t: "Byzantium Agrees to our Offer"
 vn_missions.54.d: "The [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle] [BYZ.Monarch.GetName] has agreed to our offer to send a large army of Norman mercenaries to [BYZ.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Being threatened on all sides by enemies, the Byzantines have utilized elite units such as the Varangian Guard, who are fiercely loyal to the [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle]. Our mercenaries have sworn loyalty to the [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle] and to protect the Empire from external forces, and in return we have been granted a lavish sum of money."
 vn_missions.54.a: "We hope they will make good use of these troops."
 vn_missions.55.t: "Normandy Requests Troops"
 vn_missions.55.d: "Tensions are brewing as the Norman [NRM.Monarch.GetTitle] [NRM.Monarch.GetName] has made clear his intention to seize the English throne by force if necessary, claiming that the late king Eadweard promised him the throne. Now, he is reaching out to other reputable dukedoms across the land requesting soldiers to fight the inevitable war to come.\nToday, a Norman diplomat arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] asking for our contribution. They claim their cause has even been sanctioned by the Pope himself, but we have yet to respond. How should we proceed, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 vn_missions.55.a: "Gladly, if your cause is just..."
 vn_missions.55.a.tt: "This action will cost us §R5,000§! Manpower."
 vn_missions.55.a.tt2: "We send a diplomat back to Normandy informing them of our response."
 vn_missions.55.b: "I am afraid we cannot send any at the moment."
 vn_missions.56.t: "[From.GetName] Sends Troops"
 vn_missions.56.d: "[From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] has agreed to support us in our righteous war to seize the English throne from unfit tyrants. A sizeable detachment is beginning to arrive in Normandy which will bolster our ranks considerably."
 vn_missions.56.a: "To battle, for Normandy!"
 vn_missions.57.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses to Send Troops"
 vn_missions.57.d: "Despite our diplomats' best efforts to coerce the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] to support us in our just war, our efforts ultimately proved fruitless. It unfortunately seems they are more involved with intrigues of their own."
 vn_missions.57.a: "You cowards are refusing to assist ME?!"
#SCOTLAND
 vn_missions.58.t: "The Education Act of [GetYear]"
 vn_missions.58.d: "The Education Act, passed by the Scottish parliament in 1496, required all landowners to send their eldest sons to school from the ages of 8 or 9 to study Latin, arts and the law. This made Scotland the first country in Europe to institute compulsory education, and would lay the groundwork for more legislation aimed towards improving the quality of education."
 vn_missions.58.a: "Great!"
 vn_missions.59.t: "Move Capital to London?"
 vn_missions.59.d: "England and Wales have fallen to the Scottish invaders, and settlements all across the Isles proudly raise the Scottish flag. However, there is a sizeable congregation of separatists seeking to undermine our control over the conquered regions. In order to better administrate them, we should move the seat of government to London, to legitimize our rule in the eyes of the people."
 vn_missions.59.a: "London shall henceforth be our new capital!"
 vn_missions.59.b: "[Root.Capital.GetName] is a lot more pleasant."
 vn_missions.60.t: "Founding of the National Kirk"
 vn_missions.60.d: "The Scottish Reformation, beginning in 1560, was the process by which Scotland broke from the Catholic Church and established a new Church of its own, the Kirk, which was heavily influenced by Calvinism and Presbyterianism. By the establishment of this new Church we will be able to unify the country under a single religion and end the ongoing religious turmoil."
 vn_missions.60.a: "Found the Kirk!"
 vn_missions.60.b: "We have no need of the Kirk."
#BARCELONA
 vn_missions.62.t: "Frankish Influence Wanes"
 vn_missions.62.d: "Frankish influence beyond the Pyrenees first began with the creation of the Marca Hispanica in 795 as a defensive buffer zone against the Umayyad Caliphate, which held on to most of Iberia. In 801, the County of Barcelona was acquired and made subordinate to the Marca Hispanica, though after the death of Charlemagne the Catalan states became progressively more independent from Frankish affairs.\nA turning point in the County's history came in 985, when Muslim forces under Almanzor sacked Barcelona. The Count Borrell II sent a request for help to the king of France, Lothar III, but it was refused. Upon the accession of Hugh Capet as king of France, however, Borrell once again sent a request for aid, which was finally answered, but Hugh's nobles refused to support an expedition into Iberia. This almost definitively severed the connection between France and Barcelona.\nEven though we, alongside the other Catalan counties, have been able to act with much greater independence, the fact still remains that we are de jure vassals of the king of France. With the recent build-up of our military, however, we have finally asserted our independence from the Crown for the time being."
 vn_missions.62.a: "Barcelona shall be free!"
#ENGLALONDE
 vn_missions.63.t: "The Stone of Scone"
 vn_missions.63.d: "A cornerstone of the coronation ceremony for Scottish kings for centuries, the Stone of Scone has now fallen into our hands after it was pillaged from Scone Abbey. Our possession of this invaluable artifact will no doubt strengthen our claims to the Scottish realm and augment our prestige. Meanwhile, we can put the Stone to good use for the coronation of our own kings."
 vn_missions.63.a: "Splendid!"
#MILAN
 vn_missions.64.t: "Promotion to Duchy!"
 vn_missions.64.d: "After much consideration, the ruling Emperor $EMPERORNAME$ has agreed to elevate Milan to a duchy, but at a sizeable cost. Once we are crowned, our position in the political stage will transform from a mere local power among many into a burgeoning Italian powerhouse."
 vn_missions.64.d2: "As the current Emperor, we in theory possess a great deal of authority across swathes of Central Europe, but the lowly position of our home duchy diminishes our legitimacy to rule an empire. Thankfully, we can use our authority to invest ourselves as the Dukes of Milan without the chance of resistance from outside powers."
 vn_missions.64.a: "A handsome title indeed!"
 vn_missions.64.b: "And so we shall!"
 vn_missions.65.t: "The Swiss offer their help"
 vn_missions.65.d: "Swiss mercenaries are renowned for their prowess on the battlefield, and have been hired across Europe in countless wars. As it so happens, we have managed to secure a favourable contract with one of the Swiss states, offering a sizeable portion of highly disciplined mercenaries in exchange for some coin. In our time of great need, this could be the force to turn the tide of the ongoing war in our favour."
 vn_missions.65.a: "Fight for your new masters!"
 vn_missions.66.t: "The Lombard League Forms!"
 vn_missions.66.d: "At the behest of the city-state of Milan, a number of North Italian states have banded together in order to contest the authority of the Holy Roman Emperor in Italy. This arrangement has become known as the Lega Lombarda, or Lombard League. The Emperor has already issued an imperial ban on the participating states, but this is only seeming to fuel the fires of resistance. At any rate, the Emperor faces a serious threat if the states of Lombardy are able to band together for a common cause, as they have gained the support of the Pope himself to fight Imperial encroachment."
 vn_missions.66.a: "We shall lead the resistance!"
 vn_missions.67.t: "Lombard League Disbands"
 vn_missions.67.d: "When the Lombard League was created as a means of defending against Imperial authority in Italy, the partnership had a purpose. But now the political tides have changed, and many city-states belonging to the League are questioning its continued existence without the threat of the Empire. This has meant that the League is no longer a loose confederation as it once was, and has therefore been rendered obsolete."
 vn_missions.67.a: "It should probably stay that way."
#LORRAINE
 vn_missions.68.t: "The Capital of Lotharingia"
 vn_missions.68.d: "Now that the kingdom of Lotharingia has once again been revived, a decision must be taken as to where the nation's capital should be.\nAachen, the former political center of Charlemagne's empire, is one such candidate. In order to assert our claim to the rest of the empire he once held, we could relocate to the city.\nHowever, to appeal to our own history we could move the capital to Metz, given that it was the capital of the former Kingdom of Lotharingia.\nAlternatively, the city of Nancy, the historical seat of the dukes of Lorraine, could also be a suitable capital. Which city shall we move to?"
 vn_missions.68.a: "Aachen!"
 vn_missions.68.b: "Metz!"
 vn_missions.68.c: "Nancy!"
 vn_missions.68.e: "We will stick with [Root.Capital.GetName]."
#NITRA/SLOVAKIA
 vn_missions.69.t: "[From.GetName] Requests a Union"
 vn_missions.69.d: "Recently, the [From.GetAdjectiveCap]s have admitted themselves into the Holy Roman Empire, seemingly to protect themselves against the threat of the Magyars and Poles on both sides. But they may not be secure enough, as an ambassador has reached the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] court with a request from [From.Monarch.GetName] requesting a union of the states of [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName]. While the union appears to be beneficial to us both, it could also risk compromising our national sovereignty."
 vn_missions.69.a: "We have no choice but to accept."
 vn_missions.69.b: "Their offer is outrageous!"
 vn_missions.70.t: "Reestablishment of Great Moravia"
 vn_missions.70.d: "For centuries, Great Moravia has been a distant, long-forgotten ancestor to many West Slavic states. First known to have existed in 833, it was centered around the Morava river which gave the principality its name. Under its rulers Mojmir and Rastislav, the state expanded outwards to reach its maximum extent under Svatopluk 'the Great', which included parts of Moravia, Bohemia, Slovakia and Pannonia, and even as far as the Ukraine. Although it was once no more, now that we hold the heartlands of Great Moravia, we can claim to be their successors, a prestigious feat indeed."
 vn_missions.70.a: "Endless Glory!"
#PORTUGAL
 vn_missions.77.t: "Manifestis Probatum"
 vn_missions.77.d: "In the year of our Lord, [GetYear], the Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has agreed to finally recognize us as the true sovereigns of the Kingdom of Portugal. The papal bull reads as follows:\n\n...to the most beloved son in Christ, [Root.Monarch.GetName], Illustrious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Portuguese, and to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heirs, in perpetuity:\n\nIt is clearly demonstrated that, as a good son and catholic prince, you have rendered innumerable services to your mother, the Holy Church, intrepidly exterminating through hardships and military prowess the enemies of the Christian name and diligently propagating the Christian faith, thereby leaving to generations still unborn a name worthy of memory and an example deserving of imitation...\n\nWe, therefore, because of your qualities of prudence, justice and idoneity for government, take you under the protection of Saint Peter and our own, and grant and confirm by apostolic authority to your excellent domain, the Kingdom of Portugal, full honours of kingdom and the dignity that befits kings, as well as all places which, with the help of the Celestial Grace, you have wrested from the hands of the Saracens, and to which your neighbouring Christian princes may not claim any rights...\n\nWith the Papacy now guaranteeing our rights to kingship, this will surely be an upset for any of our neighbours seeking to bring us back under their yoke."
 vn_missions.77.a: "Brilliant!"
