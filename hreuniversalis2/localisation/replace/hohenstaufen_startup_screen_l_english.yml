 string_start_title_iberia_1054: "1054 Overview: Iberia"
 string_start_region_iberia_1054: "While the Great Schism looks to be severing the eastern and western Churches, a struggle of a different character is being fought on the arid plains and mountains of Iberia.\n\nEver since the Islamic §YUmayyad§! conquest of Iberia in the 8th century, the Christian inhabitants in the north have fought back and defied attempts to subjugate them, gradually eroding the Caliphate’s grip on the continent. But despite the efforts of the Reconquista, only five decades ago the Caliphate of §YCórdoba§!, the unquestioned rulers of §YAl-Andalus§!, was united and prosperous. Córdoba itself could be called the largest city in all of Europe, and was a beacon of the Islamic world as well as a melting pot of religions and cultures.\n\nBut the cracks began to appear as a ruinous civil war engulfed the caliphate starting in 1009 between feuding brothers, a power struggle from which it would never recover. The once mighty caliphate is now a shadow of its former self in 1054, reduced to a republican state with the rest divided among competing taifas. But there may yet be hope for the ambitions of caliphs in centuries past to be fulfilled; it is only the question of who will seize the opportunity, and if they can survive the looming threat to the north.\n\nMeanwhile, the Christian kingdoms of Iberia are numerous but committed to the cause of liberating the south. The kingdom of §YLeón§!, the most prominent, has recently united §YGalicia§! and §YCastile§! under the rule of its king §YFernando I§!, posing a significant threat to the bordering taifas. As a result of constant warfare, the borderlands have become a depopulated no man’s land, though the hotly contested border in the west is checked by the march of §YPortucale§!. Even gold is playing an increasingly important role as the north uses its influence to demand payments (parias) from the weaker taifas.\n\nIn the east, the kingdom of §YNavarra§! is in a precarious situation. Disagreements with their Leónese neighbors may prove problematic in the near future as the kingdom struggles to reverse its ongoing decline. And the kingdom of §YAragon§!, though small, may become a powerful player on the continent if it can acquire a stake in the Reconquista. The county of §YBarcelona§!, along with the other polities of §YCatalonia§!, are now independent from the French crown in all but name as the task is left to them to drive out the Islamic presence from the region."
 string_start_title_france_1054: "1054 Overview: France"
 string_start_region_france_1054: "High Middle Ages §YFrance§!: a prosperous, united kingdom with unrivalled power and influence, the cradle of Western Europe. Or so it would seem on an ordinary map.\n\nThe reality of France in 1054 is one of fragmentation and division, far from the glory days of §YCharlemagne§!’s empire in the 9th century. Though the §YCapet§! dynasty based in §YParis§! claims de jure authority over the whole of the kingdom, the fiefs of the realm are often distanced from affairs in the capital and their loyalties are largely symbolic. Many powerful vassals, such as those of §YNormandy§!, §YChampagne§! and §YToulouse§! act more or less independently of the king, facilitated by cultural and linguistic divides. Some, such as the dukes of §YBrittany§! and §YFlanders§!, are merely vassals in name and refuse to respect the king's authority.\n\nBut all across the realm, signs of change are on the horizon. Brittany is beset by a fierce dynastic conflict, one that could determine the nation's course. Meanwhile, the Norman duke §YGuillaume I§! consolidates his power, having thwarted recent French and §YAngevin§! invasions; now being an unlikely candidate for the §YEnglish§! throne, he schemes to seize it whether through peaceful or hostile means, but not without opposition from the English themselves and rival claimants as far afield as §YNorway§!. In addition, large duchies that were once dominant, such as §YAquitaine§!, have begun to fracture into smaller states as lesser lords carve out local lands for themselves.\n\nThe winds of change are also reverberating throughout society. Communes have begun to develop in the already expanding and prospering market towns, and fundamental changes in the principles of feudalism are reshaping the political landscape. In the absence of strong central authority, powerful magnates are rapidly rising to prominence, many of which may in the future seek glory outside the kingdom’s borders. But for now, it remains to be seen who will take advantage of these developments.\n\nDespite the significant challenges facing the French king, §YHenri I§!, from all sides, a succession of strong monarchs may yet be able to extend their royal demesne outside Paris and bring the defiant vassals to heel. But to ultimately succeed, they must manoeuver between external dangers, the most pressing being the §YHoly Roman Empire§! to the east, while also curtailing the power of the lords within their borders. Diplomacy, war and the complexities of feudalism must all play to their advantage in this struggle; France’s fate lies in their hands…"

 string_start_region_germany_1054: "The §YHoly Roman Empire§! is undoubtedly one of the most powerful entities in Europe in 1054. Divided into hundreds of autonomous counties and duchies, the Emperor, King of §YGermany§!, §YBurgundy§! and §YItaly§!, rules over many different peoples of the continent.\n\nAfter the extinction of the §YLuitpoldingers§! in 1024, Count §YConrad II§! of §YWorms§! was elected Emperor, member of the §YSalier§! dynasty, who has ruled the Empire ever since. Through the promotion of imperial secular and ecclesiastical institutions, such as the construction of the Cathedral of §YSpeyer§!, hitherto the largest existing cathedral, the Emperor's political position was greatly solidified and expanded. Although many princes dislike the Emperor's growing power, clever moves on the board of power have made it possible to avoid major conspiracies and rebellions so far...\n\nThe Duchy of §YSaxony§!, located in the north of Germany, which is ruled by the house of §YBillung§!, has frequently opposed the Emperors in the past, who might revolt again under a weak Emperor, trying to influence the surrounding counties. But also the south, the Duchies of §YSwabia§! and §YBavaria§! play an important role in the imperial politics, whereby the latter is currently experiencing a phase of instability, after the former Duke §YConrad I von Welf§! was deposed by Emperor §YHenry III§! because of his disloyalty. Swabia's dukes, however, have always appeared as loyal allies of the Emperor, receiving several counties and cities as imperial donations. The Duchy of §YBohemia§!, the only §YSlavic§! territory in the Empire, has been weakened in recent years by conflicts with the §YPolish§! Crown and the Emperor but could turn out to be a dangerous enemy for them if the Duke is able to consolidate his domain.\n\nThe Empire borders on Slavic tribal territory in the north, which is ruled by heathen tribesmen. The subjugation of these region has turned out to be difficult in the past, as its inhabitants have persistently defended themselves against their conquerors, thus repulsing them again. The counts and dukes close to the border will still attempt to subjugate the tribes permanently in order to obtain new land for settlement. However, not only the Holy Roman Emperor hast cast an eye on these areas, but also the Kings of §YDenmark§! and Poland.\n\nTechnically, all Imperial Princes have the potential to become the next Emperor, but only time will tell which dynasty will obtain the approval of the Electors and be able to kick the Salians off the Imperial Throne in the end."
 string_start_title_italy_1054: "1054 Overview: Italy"
 string_start_region_italy_1054: "The northern half of §YItaly§! is part of the §YHoly Roman Empire§! and is mainly ruled by small counties and bishoprics, while the §YByzantine Empire§! clings to its last Italian fortresses in the south.\n\nThe merchant republics of §YPisa§!, §YVenice§! and §YGenoa§! have focused on trade and navy and will eventually compete against each other for trading dominance in Italy and the Mediterranean Sea. The Margraviate of §YTuscany§! is formed around the most fertile region of Italy, with the wealthy capital of §YFlorence§!, providing its rulers with lavish treasuries. Under the young but talented heiress §YMatilde Attoning§!, it might ascend to a Grand Duchy – or collapse as a result of succession conflicts.\n\n§YRome§!, the Holiest City of Christianity next to Jerusalem, is ruled by the §YPapal States§!, whose influence extends beyond the city to the Adriatic coast, but is also subject to the Holy Roman Emperor itself. Thanks to the Emperor's help, the Papacy was liberated from the grips of Roman aristocracy in 1046, which allowed the Popes to initiate reforms of the Catholic Church, gradually strengthening the Pope's position. Pope §YVictor II§! and his successors will certainly not deviate from this course, trying to make the Papacy the most influential authority in the Catholic World...\n\nIn southern Italy, the Byzantine Empire is attempting to defend its last possessions against an alliance of §YLombards§! and §YNormans§! for years now, who were originally hired as mercenaries as support against Saracen pirates. Thanks to their past victories, the Norman house of §YHauteville§! has  acquired a considerable territory for themselves and was appointed 'Duke of §YApulia§! and §YCalabria§!' by the Pope. After the Greeks have been expelled from Italy altogether, the Normans will certainly try to expand their territory even further.\n\nBecause of their wealth, the islands of §YCorsica§! and §YSardinia§! are frequently targeted by Saracen pirates, but over time they have learned to defend themselves against them. However, due to their central location in the Mediterranean Sea, they might serve as potential trading colonies for the trade republics of Pisa, Genoa and §YAmalfi§!. Therefore, they should beware of invasion attempts from the mainland in the future.\n\nAfter the collapse of Byzantine rule in the 9th century, the §YFatimids§! took over §YSicily§!, who have already lost control of the island however, that is now ruled by warring Muslim qadits. Without a strong emir or sultan to unite them, they are easy prey for §YIfriqiya§! or their Christian neighbors."
