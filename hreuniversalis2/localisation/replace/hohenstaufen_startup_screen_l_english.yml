 string_start_region_germany_1054: "The §YHoly Roman Empire§! is undoubtedly one of the most powerful entities in Europe in 1054. Divided into hundreds of autonomous counties and duchies, the Emperor, §YKing of Germany§!, §YBurgundy§! and §YItaly§!, rules over many different peoples of the continent.\n\nAfter the extinction of the Luitpoldingers in 1024, Count Conrad II of §YWorms§! was elected Emperor, member of the §YSalier§! dynasty, who has ruled the Empire ever since. Through the promotion of imperial secular and ecclesiastical institutions, such as the construction of the §YCathedral of Speyer§!, hitherto the largest existing cathedral, the Emperor's political position was greatly solidified and expanded. Although many princes dislike the Emperor's growing power, clever moves on the board of power have made it possible to avoid major conspiracies and rebellions so far...\n\nThe Duchy of §YSaxony§!, located in the north of Germany, which is ruled by the house of §YBillung§!, has frequently opposed the Emperors in the past, who might revolt again under a weak Emperor, trying to influence the surrounding counties. But also the south, the Duchies of §YSwabia§! and §YBavaria§! play an important role in the imperial politics, whereby the latter is currently experiencing a phase of instability, after the former §YDuke Conrad I von Welf§! was deposed by §YEmperor Henry III§! because of his disloyalty. Swabia's dukes, however, have always appeared as loyal allies of the Emperor, receiving several counties and cities as imperial donations. The Duchy of §YBohemia§!, the only Slavic territory in the Empire, has been weakened in recent years by conflicts with the §YPolish Crown§! and the Emperor but could turn out to be a dangerous enemy for them if the Duke is able to consolidate his domain.\n\nThe Empire borders on §YSlavic§! tribal territory in the north, which is ruled by heathen tribesmen. The subjugation of these region has turned out to be difficult in the past, as its inhabitants have persistently defended themselves against their conquerors, thus repulsing them again. The counts and dukes close to the border will still attempt to subjugate the tribes permanently in order to obtain new land for settlement. However, not only the Holy Roman Emperor hast cast an eye on these areas, but also the Kings of §YDenmark§! and §YPoland§!.\n\nTechnically, all Imperial Princes have the potential to become the next Emperor, but only time will tell which dynasty will obtain the approval of the Electors and be able to kick the Salians off the Imperial Throne in the end."

 string_start_region_italy_1054: "The northern half of §YItaly§! is part of the §YHoly Roman Empire§! and is mainly ruled by small counties and bishoprics, while the §YByzantine Empire§! clings to its last Italian fortresses in the south.\n\nThe merchant republics of §YPisa§!, §YVenice§! and §YGenoa§! have focused on trade and navy and will eventually compete against each other for trading dominance in Italy and the Mediterranean Sea. The §YMargraviate of Tuscany§! is formed around the most fertile region of Italy, with the wealthy capital of §YFlorence§!, providing its rulers with lavish treasuries. Under the young but talented heiress §YMatilde Attoning§!, it might ascend to a Grand Duchy – or collapse as a result of succession conflicts.\n\n§YRome§!, the Holiest City of Christianity next to Jerusalem, is ruled by the §YPapal States§!, whose influence extends beyond the city to the Adriatic coast, but is also subject to the Holy Roman Emperor itself. Thanks to the Emperor's help, the Papacy was liberated from the grips of Roman aristocracy in 1046, which allowed the Popes to initiate reforms of the §YCatholic Church§!, gradually strengthening the Pope's position. §YPope Victor II§! and his successors will certainly not deviate from this course, trying to make the Papacy the most influential authority in the Catholic World...\n\nIn southern Italy, the Byzantine Empire is attempting to defend its last possessions against an alliance of Lombards and Normans for years now, who were originally hired as mercenaries as support against Saracen pirates. Thanks to their past victories, the Norman house of §!Hauteville§! has  acquired a considerable territory for themselves and was appointed '§YDuke of Apulia and Calabria§!' by the Pope. After the Greeks have been expelled from Italy altogether, the Normans will certainly try to expand their territory even further.\n\nBecause of their wealth, the islands of §YCorsica§! and §YSardinia§! are frequently targeted by Saracen pirates, but over time they have learned to defend themselves against them. However, due to their central location in the Mediterranean Sea, they might serve as potential trading colonies for the trade republics of §YPisa§!, §YGenoa§! and §YAmalfi§!. Therefore, they should beware of invasion attempts from the mainland in the future.\n\nAfter the collapse of Byzantine rule in the 9th century, the §YFatimids§! took over §YSicily§!, who have already lost control of the island however, that is now ruled by warring §YMuslim§! qadits. Without a strong emir or sultan to unite them, they are easy prey for §YIfriqiya§! or their Christian neighbors."
