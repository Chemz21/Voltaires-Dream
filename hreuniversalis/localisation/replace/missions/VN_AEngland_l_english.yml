 vn_ase_reincorporate_northumbria_title: "Reincorporate Northumbria"
 vn_ase_reincorporate_northumbria_desc: "The Earldom of Northumbria is one of the largest in England and their Earls are supposed to rule in our name, but lately it seems they have been granted too much leeway and could threaten us in the future. We must rectify this at once."
 vn_ase_assimilate_danes_title: "Assimilate the Danelaw"
 vn_ase_assimilate_danes_desc: "The Danelaw is a vast region encompassing the entire north of England and much of the Midlands. Forged by the Viking invasions and the subsequent settlement of Scandinavians, it has developed a culture and laws very different from our own. Although we tried to aggressively purge the Danes from the country in the past, this has not ended well for us; we should instead peacefully assimilate those in the Danelaw and progressively erode the legal and cultural differences between north and south."
 vn_ase_conquer_strathclyde_title: "Conquer Strathclyde"
 vn_ase_conquer_strathclyde_desc: "The Kingdom of Strathclyde sits not just on the border between the English and Scottish, but also on valuable silver deposits. We must liquidate them to prepare for the eventual subjugation of Scotland."
 vn_ase_conquer_highlands_title: "Control the Highlands"
 vn_ase_conquer_highlands_desc: "We may have underestimated the resolve of the Scots and the unforgiving terrain, but we are by no means done with our conquests. We must push into the Highlands and beyond, rooting out any resistance."

 vn_bypass_this_mission: "This mission can be bypassed if the conditions are not met."
 vn_ase_elect_new_king_desc: "The Anglo-Saxon succession is elective rather than strictly hereditary; this gives the Witenagemot power to elect the next king upon the incumbent's death. While Edward the Confessor did have a closer living relative, Edgar Aetheling, he was a mere child and so Edward's brother-in-law, Harold Godwinson, became the primary candidate instead. It seems clear that we will need a strong king to steer us through the troubling times ahead, so we must settle with the Witan's decision."
 vn_ase_a_kingdom_consolidated_title: "A Kingdom Consolidated"
 vn_ase_a_kingdom_consolidated_desc: "The last few decades have been very trying for our kingdom, with two simultaneous threats from overseas to our throne.

 vn_ase_build_up_fyrd_desc: "The regular troops that make up the fyrd, the bulk of the Anglo-Saxon army, have traditionally received little training and are drawn from the peasant ranks. We should not only build up the fyrd to be larger but also better trained."
 vn_ase_reclaim_lothian_title: "Reclaim Lothian"
 vn_ase_reclaim_lothian_desc: "Lothian once belonged to the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, but was lost in the 10th century to the Scots. Finally, we are prepared to take it back from them, opening the way to the Central Belt and the Highlands of Scotland."
 vn_ase_control_eastern_scotland_title: "Eastern Scotland"
 vn_ase_control_eastern_scotland_desc: "We may have underestimated the resolve of the Scots and the unforgiving terrain, but we are by no means done with our conquests. We must push into the Highlands and beyond, rooting out any resistance."

 vn_ase_anglo_scottish_union_desc: "Whether by sheer diplomatic luck or by brute force, we have managed to secure Scotland as a part of the English crown. From here on, we will seal a union between the two countries, paving the way to a United Kingdom of Great Britain."
 vn_ase_drive_out_normans_title: "Drive out the Normans"

 vn_ase_end_isolation_title: "End Isolation"
 vn_ase_end_isolation_desc: "Edward the Confessor's foreign policy was one of relative isolation as opposed to earlier Anglo-Saxon kings, which left us vulnerable when we were threatened by foreign claimants. We should seek to reverse this policy and open up more diplomatic links again."
 vn_ase_beyond_offas_dyke_title: "Beyond Offa's Dyke"
 vn_ase_beyond_offas_dyke_desc: "Offa's Dyke is a centuries-old fortification built across almost the entire length of the Welsh border by the Mercian king Offa. While this has aided in our defense against the Welsh raiding across the border every now and then, we could eliminate that threat completely if we expand beyond the Dyke."
 vn_ase_subdue_wales_title: "Subdue Wales"
 vn_ase_subdue_wales_desc: "Having established a substantial foothold beyond the Dyke, we can advance to the sea and conquer Wales in its entirety. No longer will they simply be 'foreigners'!"

 vn_ase_anglo_saxon_fleet_title: "Anglo-Saxon Fleet"
 vn_ase_anglo_saxon_fleet_desc: "In the past, our fleet has been woefully inadequate compared to those of the Vikings or even the mainland Europeans. By taking advantage of our long coastline and many harbors, we can construct a new naval fleet to repulse any invasion."

 vn_ase_norman_castles_title: "Norman Castles"
 vn_ase_norman_castles_desc: "The Normans may have been our adversaries, but we must admit that they had excellent castles. By adapting their designs and using them to control our towns and borders, we will be far more secure against invasions and rebellions."

 vn_ase_growth_of_burhs_desc: "The burh is the traditional Anglo-Saxon town, located within a fortified enclosure; although this design has been beneficial in wartime, in peacetime it is constraining their expansion. We should encourage the burhs to grow beyond their medieval walls and compensate for this with extra defenses."
 vn_ase_northern_connections_title: "Northern Trade Routes"

Its beautiful carved corbels, arches, and statuettes are now in disrepair, and the monks often can't even spare candles to light up its lofty interior. Eadweard the Confessor started to fund a renovation project a few years ago in order to have a fitting tomb in which to be buried and to give the abbey the prestige it deserves, but supplies are now running short. The architects request one last lump sum of gold and promise the project will then be completed, adding yet another jewel to the Westminster area."
