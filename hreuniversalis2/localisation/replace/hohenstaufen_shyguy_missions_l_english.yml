#Taifa RELs
 vn_missions.1.t: "Restoration of the Caliphate of Cordoba"
 vn_missions.1.d: "The Caliph of Cordoba ruled most of the Iberian Peninsula for nearly 100 years, until he was deprived of power by internal power struggles in 1031. The peaceful coexistence of different peoples under one regent made it the first high culture of medieval Europe alongside Byzantium.\n\nWith our increased influence on the Muslim world, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can appoint [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] Caliph, head of [Root.Religion.GetName] Islam."
 vn_missions.1.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is truly the deputy of Prophet Mohammed"
 vn_missions.1.b: "Nobody is worthy to bear this title"
#Florence
 vn_missions.2.t: "New Stocking of our Libraries"
 vn_missions.2.d: "For centuries, our books collections and libraries have provided our scholars, scientists and advisors with vast amounts of ancient and modern knowledge, driving them to new accomplishments. Thanks to the book printing that is now spread throughout Europe, it is possible for us to reproduce this knowledge with little effort. The possibilities are endless, but we have to decide which books to print first."
 vn_missions.2.a: "Philosophy has always fascinated us"
 vn_missions.2.b: "We can improve our diplomatic skills by learning from Roman statesmen"
 vn_missions.2.c: "Let us look ahead and explore modern warfare"
#Apulia
 vn_missions.3.t: "Sicilians under Foreign Rule"
 vn_missions.3.d: "For decades we have ruled over Italians, but our nobility and clergy largely remained of Norman culture. We are united in faith, but the cultural differences are tremendous,  which constantly leads to tensions with the common people. To tackle this problem, we could try to spread our culture among the rural population as well, so that they slowly accept it and give up their own. Alternatively, we could abandon [Root.Culture.GetName] customs and embrace Sicilian culture as primary culture."
 vn_missions.3.a: "Spread our culture intensively"
 vn_missions.3.b: "The days we used to call ourselves [Root.Culture.GetName] are over"
#Latin Empire
 vn_missions.4.t: "Demands of the Venetians"
 vn_missions.4.d: "After the successful but costly crusade, our treasuries are strained and the Venetians demand reparations from us, although we have been their allies! We cannot afford to squeeze our scarce funds to greedy Doges, yet our advisors have proposed a solution to this. By stealing and melting down relics from Orthodox churches, we will be able to improve our financial situation and pay the Venetians. This would, however, make the Greeks dislike us even more than they already do."
 vn_missions.4.a: "Melt them down and turn them into money!"
 vn_missions.4.b: "The Venetians shall curb their greed!"
#Chiny/Vermandois/Soissons
 vn_missions.5.t: "Coronation in Rome"
 vn_missions.5.d: "After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Charlemagne was the first Western European ruler to be crowned Emperor in 800, claiming the heritage of the Roman Emperors. With the coronation of Otto the Great, however, the Imperial Title has ceased to be in the hands of the once so great Carolingians. Instead, the German Kings have borne this coveted title, and have called themselves Holy Roman Emperors ever since.\nDue to our expansion into France, Lotharingia and Lombardy and the takeover of these regal titles, it is truly no longer adequate to call us a [Root.GovernmentName]. For this reason, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] travelled to Rome, where the Pope felt compelled to award [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] an Imperial Title. This will undoubtedly confirm our splendour, but it may cause an imbalance of power in Europe."
 vn_missions.5.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will be the keenest of all Emperors!"
#Genoa
 vn_missions.6.t: "The Purchase of Chios"
 vn_missions.6.d: "Thanks to our excellent relations with [2341.owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [2341.owner.Monarch.GetName] [2341.owner.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] in recent years causing our two nations to prosper, we have received a particularly promising offer: Due to their richness, the Aegean islands are often attacked by pirates, which is why [2341.owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [2341.owner.Monarch.GetName] has proposed the sale of the island of Chios to let us take care of its defence. We will be able to use it as a naval base, which will make it easier to perform own military operations in the future, but also as a trading hub, increasing our trade influence there.\nDo we want to be appointed commander of this island?"
 vn_missions.6.a: "Give them the money they demand"
 vn_missions.6.b: "Cancel the negotiations"
#Nicea/Epirus/Trebizond
 vn_missions.7.t: "The Reconquest of Constantinople"
 vn_missions.7.d: "For centuries, Constantinople, the Queen of all Cities, has been the center of Western culture, science and trade. Temporarily, hundreds of thousands of people lived in the metropolis, protected by the strongest city walls of the known world. It was not until the momentous Fourth Crusade that the city was for the first time expropriated from Greek hands; the Eastern Roman Empire was considered to have perished. However, thanks to our masterful diplomacy and successful campaigns, we were able to recapture the city that had once been regarded as impregnable. Now we have the choice to return to Constantinople and legitimize our rightful claim to the Roman heritage."
 vn_missions.7.a: "It is time for us to revert to Constantinople"
 vn_missions.7.b: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is better suited as a capital for our ambitions"
#Teutonic Order
 vn_missions.8.t: "The Foundation of Königsberg"
 vn_missions.8.d: "Thanks to the urbanization of the estuaries of the Mottlau, Nogat and Pregel rivers, these regions have become a magnet for domestic and foreign settlers and traders. Especially the city of Königsberg has rapidly grown from an insignificant village to a center for economy and trade. As a result, it could be a better place to rule than our current capital."
 vn_missions.8.a: "Move our seat to Königsberg"
 vn_missions.8.b: "Rather invest in [Root.Capital.GetName]"
#Byzantium
 vn_missions.9.t: "Byzantine [From.Monarch.GetTitle] Seeks Papal Support"
 vn_missions.9.d: "For centuries, the Byzantine Empire has been trotted over by internal rebellions, foreign invasions, incompetent Emperors and brutal pretenders. After the lost battle of Manzikert against the Seljuks, the Emperor lost most of his control over Anatolia, which is now ruled by Muslim invaders.\nSince the Byzantine army is in a miserable state leaded by disloyal generals, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has sent an embassy to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to ask [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] for reinforcements to combat the acute threats in [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] Empire. Although our relations have been difficult since the Great Schism, we ought to assure them our support to prevent the spread of Islam to the western side of the Bosporus."
 vn_missions.9.a: "We are still committed to Christian mercy and generosity"
 vn_missions.9.b: "The issues of the Byzantine [From.Monarch.GetTitle] are no longer our concern."
 vn_missions.9.tt: "We will send a diplomat back to Byzantium informing them of our response."
 vn_missions.10.t: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] Promises Support"
 vn_missions.10.d: "Our diplomats have returned with joyful news. Concerned about the devastating Seljuk invasion of Anatolia and the spreading of Islam, the Pope has promised his help to ward off the invaders. Although this may only be an alliance of convenience and may not resolve our religious and cultural differences, we are grateful for this required aid."
 vn_missions.10.a: "Very good!"
 vn_missions.11.t: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] Refuses Support"
 vn_missions.11.d: "Our request for support has fallen on deaf ears at [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName]! The hatred against us, caused by the recent schism, still seems to vitiate any diplomatic approaches. We will not be able to rely on the Catholic Church in the future anymore."
 vn_missions.11.a: "What a shame!"
 vn_missions.12.t: "Regnum Bospori"
 vn_missions.12.d: "Thanks to successful campaigns in recent years, we were able to claim the other side of the Black Sea coast for ourselves. Since this region was already ruled by a Roman client state in Roman times, the question now arises whether we should relinquish the local administration in order to focus our attention on other regions of our Empire."
 vn_missions.12.a: "Appoint a viceroy"
 vn_missions.12.b: "We do not need a client state"
#Savoy
 vn_missions.13.t: "An Unique Opportunity"
 vn_missions.13.d: "Now retired in his castle in Ripaille, our duke Amadeus VIII has become a deeply pious man. He now spends most of his time praying, not unlike a monk. However, the council of Florence has recently come to make him an interesting proposition: they seek to undermine the power of the Pope, and, to do so, are ready to elect him as an Antipope. While the prestige from such a title would be immense, this would without any doubt attract the ire of the Catholic world - especially His Holiness himself. Should Amadeus VIII accept?"
 vn_missions.13.a: "No, this would be heresy"
 vn_missions.13.b: "Yes, the Pope is no longer infallible!"
#Sardinia
 vn_missions.14.t: "Regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae"
 vn_missions.14.d: "In the year of our Lord, [GetYear], the Pope has come to a decision regarding the fate of Sardinia. Thanks to our diligent guidance, he has come to make a wise choice: the duchy of Sardinia shall be ruled by its natives and its natives alone, and [Root.Monarch.GetName], duke of Sardinia and Corsica, shall be their ruler."
 vn_missions.14.a: "Excellent news!"
#Sardinia-Piedmont
 vn_missions.15.t: "The Papal States evicted from Romagna!"
 vn_missions.15.d: "Has the Lord forsaken us? Today, in the year $YEAR$, the armies of [From.GetName], devil's kith and kin, have overrun our rightful territories in Romagna. While we will without any doubt effortlessly take it back from those brutes, this will greatly affect our diplomatic reputation."
 vn_missions.15.a: "Infidels!"
#Georgia
 vn_missions.16.t: "The Future of the Armenian Church"
 vn_missions.16.d: "The Armenians have always been adherents of Miaphysite Christianity, which split off from the rest of Christianity in the 5th century. Consequently, the important question now arises as to how we will deal with these alleged heretics in our conquered territories.\nAn option might be to keep the Armenian Apostolic Church as an equal institution in our state and allow the Armenians to continue to practise their faith. Alternatively, we will opt for a much more radical course, namely the dissolution of the Armenian Church to enable the [Root.GetAdjective] Church to put out its feelers to Armenia, which will certainly cause unrest among our Armenian subjects though. With sufficient finesse, we might instead strike a balance by slowly starting to integrate the Armenian ecclesiastical institutions into our own, thereby merging the two Churches in the long run. What do we choose, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 vn_missions.16.a: "Maintain an independent Armenian Apostolic Church"
 vn_missions.16.b: "Extend the influence of the [Root.GetAdjective] Church"
 vn_missions.16.c: "Strive for integration into the [Root.GetAdjective] Church"
#Cologne
 vn_missions.17.t: "New Electoral Residence?"
 vn_missions.17.d: "The patricians of Cologne are disturbed by the duties and taxes that we levy on the roads and streets along the Rhine. Since our secular possessions now extend far beyond the banks of the Rhine, we could expand a more distant city into a new residential city. In this way, we will shift our political and economic focus in order to weaken the rebellious people of Cologne."
 vn_missions.17.a: "It is not far from Cologne to Bonn"
 vn_missions.17.b: "Arnsberg is a lovely town, isn't it?"
 vn_missions.17.c: "We do not need a new capital"
 vn_missions.18.c: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is my favourite as a matter of course"
 vn_missions.18.t: "The Shrine of the Three Kings"
 vn_missions.18.d: "Thanks to our great political importance in the Holy Roman Empire, the Emperor has given us a magnificent gift: the Bones of the Three Magi. These unique relics will certainly attract thousands of pilgrims to Cologne to praise the Lord every .\nOur advisors are sure that our old Cathedral will not be able to handle these expected crowds. Let us therefore begin with the construction of a new Cathedral, which will surpass all previous church towers by far and will demonstrate our unlimited prestige!"
 vn_missions.18.a: "Lay the foundation of a new Cathedral"
#Bavaria
 vn_missions.19.t: "The Bavarian Electorate"
 vn_missions.19.d1: "To this day, we still have no idea why we have been denied the Electoral Dignity - by far the most glorious title alongside the Emperor's one itself. Thanks to our recent inheritance, however, our dukes can call themselves Electors. But this title is not tied to their primary title, so we could lose it quickly if something erodes our rule. That is why we should make every effort to transfer the loose electoral dignity over to our primary title - the Duchy of Bavaria."
 vn_missions.19.d2: "Bavaria and the House [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] have always been destined to unexpected greatness! Thus, it is absolutely justified that the Emperor once rewarded us with the Electoral Dignity, which shows the whole world that we belong to the most important princes of the Empire."
 vn_missions.19.a: "Claim the Electorship for ourselves"
 vn_missions.19.b: "We do not need that"
 vn_missions.19.c: "Splendid!"
 vn_missions.20.t: "Secularization Of Cologne"
 vn_missions.20.d: "For a long time, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the most powerful Catholic imperial princes north of the Alps. During the Reformation, Protestants thus attempted to gain control of the archbishopric and acquire a strong ally by doing so, but this was luckily prevented by our quick intervention.\nWe must not allow this to happen again, which is why we could seize power in Cologne ourselves in order to preserve the Catholic faith and expand our own influence on north-eastern Germany. Do we dare to perform this drastic step?"
 vn_missions.20.a: "Enfeoff the newly created duchy to a relative"
 vn_missions.20.b: "This is going too far"
#Venice
 vn_missions.21.t: "Carta Concessionis"
 vn_missions.21.d: "To secure Venetian control of the distant island of Crete, we should consider distributing it to Venetian knights and burghers who will be led by a feudal duke. This would not only allow us to keep the local population in check, but also to promote the development of the island and our trade influence in the eastern Mediterranean Sea."
 vn_missions.21.a: "Assign the island to a duke"
 vn_missions.21.a: "We keep control of Crete ourselves"
#Qahira
 vn_missions.22.t: "Resistance of Qahira"
 vn_missions.22.d: "The Mongolian Empire is expanding uncontrollably to the west, and no army, no general has ever been able to stop those fierce horsemen. However, the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has sworn not to leave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects to the Mongols without resistance - something dozens of other rulers have desperately failed to achieve before.\nWe know exactly that the dreaded warriors of the Mongols are marching towards [Root.Capital.GetName] at that very moment, scorching every village and farm they meet as well as robbing, raping and slaughtering our people on their way. The coming battles might appear to be hopeless, but at the same time we know that only we have the chance to vanquish the nimbus of Mongolian Invincibility!"
 vn_missions.22.a: "To arms!"
#Toulouse
 vn_missions.23.t: "Principality of Toulouse"
 vn_missions.23.d: "The Frankish Kings often tried to restrict the autonomy of the Occitan rulers in the past and to bind them more closely to the French Crown. Because of the weakness of [frankish_king.Monarch.GetTitle] [frankish_king.Monarch.GetName] [frankish_king.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], we were able to maintain our de facto independence and even claim other counties of the region for ourselves. The influence of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has now grown to such an extent that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can easily compete with the [frankish_king.GetAdjective] [frankish_king.Monarch.GetTitle] for supremacy in southern France and beyond. Because of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] accomplishments, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has crowned [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] Prince of [Root.GetName]."
 vn_missions.23.a: "The Frankish Crown will soon be ours, too!"
 vn_missions.24.t: "Catharism in Toulouse"
 vn_missions.24.d: "After [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has ostracized the Cathars at the Third Council of the Lateran, all dutiful Christian rulers are called upon to take decisive action against heresies. Also in our realm the Cathar heresy has spread quite fast in recent years. By now it has met with great approval among peasantry, nobility and even clergy. If we want to exterminate the Cathars, we will thus have to take action against the majority of our subjects. This would certainly devastate and weaken our country for generations, but the Pope would encourage our efforts."
 vn_missions.24.a: "As long as they are Christians, we will not prosecute them"
 vn_missions.24.b: "They are obviously heretics and must burn at the stake!"
#Swabia
 vn_missions.25.t: "Hoffest of Mainz"
 vn_missions.25.d: ""
 vn_missions.25.a: "Entire Europe shall see our immense prestige"
 vn_missions.25.b: "The whole Empire should assemble in Mainz"
 vn_missions.25.c: "We do not waste more money than needed on such trifles"
