#Florence
 vn_missions.2.t: "New Stocking of our Libraries"
 vn_missions.2.d: "For centuries, our books collections and libraries have provided our scholars, scientists and advisors with vast amounts of ancient and modern knowledge, driving them to new accomplishments. Thanks to the book printing that is now spread throughout Europe, it is possible for us to reproduce this knowledge with little effort. The possibilities are endless, but we have to decide which books to print first."
 vn_missions.2.a: "Philosophy has always fascinated us"
 vn_missions.2.b: "We can improve our diplomatic skills by learning from Roman statesmen"
 vn_missions.2.c: "Let us look ahead and explore modern warfare"
#Apulia
 vn_missions.3.t: "Sicilians under Foreign Rule"
 vn_missions.3.d: "For decades we have ruled over Italians, but our nobility and clergy largely remained of Norman culture. We are united in faith, but the cultural differences are tremendous,  which constantly leads to tensions with the common people. To tackle this problem, we could try to spread our culture among the rural population as well, so that they slowly accept it and give up their own. Alternatively, we could abandon [Root.Culture.GetName] customs and embrace Sicilian culture as primary culture."
 vn_missions.3.a: "Spread our culture intensively"
 vn_missions.3.b: "The days we used to call ourselves [Root.Culture.GetName] are over"
#Latin Empire
 vn_missions.4.t: "Demands of the Venetians"
 vn_missions.4.d: "After the successful but costly crusade, our treasuries are strained and the Venetians demand reparations from us, although we have been their allies! We cannot afford to squeeze our scarce funds to greedy Doges, yet our advisors have proposed a solution to this. By stealing and melting down relics from Orthodox churches, we will be able to improve our financial situation and pay the Venetians. This would, however, make the Greeks dislike us even more than they already do."
 vn_missions.4.a: "Melt them down and turn them into money!"
 vn_missions.4.b: "The Venetians shall curb their greed!"
#Chiny/Vermandois/Soissons
 vn_missions.5.t: "Coronation in Rome"
 vn_missions.5.d: "After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Charlemagne was the first Western European ruler to be crowned Emperor in 800, claiming the heritage of the Roman Emperors. With the coronation of Otto the Great, however, the Imperial Title has ceased to be in the hands of the once so great Carolingians. Instead, the German Kings have borne this coveted title, and have called themselves Holy Roman Emperors ever since.\nDue to our expansion into France, Lotharingia and Lombardy and the takeover of these regal titles, it is truly no longer adequate to call us a [Root.GovernmentName]. For this reason, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] travelled to Rome, where the Pope felt compelled to award [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] an Imperial Title. This will undoubtedly confirm our splendour, but it may cause an imbalance of power in Europe."
 vn_missions.5.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will be the keenest of all Emperors!"

 vn_missions.6.t: "The Purchase of Chios"
 vn_missions.6.d: "Thanks to our excellent relations with [2341.owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [2341.owner.Monarch.GetName] [2341.owner.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] in recent years causing our two nations to prosper, we have received a particularly promising offer: Due to their richness, the Aegean islands are often attacked by pirates, which is why [2341.owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [2341.owner.Monarch.GetName] has proposed the sale of the island of Chios to let us take care of its defence. We will be able to use it as a naval base, which will make it easier to perform own military operations in the future, but also as a trading hub, increasing our trade influence there.\nDo we want to be appointed commander of this island?"
 vn_missions.6.a: "Give them the money they demand"
 vn_missions.6.b: "Cancel the negotiations"

 vn_missions.7.t: "The Reconquest of Constantinople"
 vn_missions.7.d: "For centuries, Constantinople, the Queen of all Cities, has been the center of Western culture, science and trade. Temporarily, hundreds of thousands of people lived in the metropolis, protected by the strongest city walls of the known world. It was not until the momentous Fourth Crusade that the city was for the first time expropriated from Greek hands; the Eastern Roman Empire was considered to have perished. However, thanks to our masterful diplomacy and successful campaigns, we were able to recapture the city that had once been regarded as impregnable. Now we have the choice to return to Constantinople and legitimize our rightful claim to the Roman heritage."
 vn_missions.7.a: "It is time for us to revert to Constantinople"
 vn_missions.7.b: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is better suited as a capital for our ambitions"
#Teutonic Order
 vn_missions.8.t: "The Foundation of Königsberg"
 vn_missions.8.d: "Thanks to the urbanization of the estuaries of the Mottlau, Nogat and Pregel rivers, these regions have become a magnet for domestic and foreign settlers and traders. Especially the city of Königsberg has rapidly grown from an insignificant village to a center for economy and trade. As a result, it could be a better place to rule than our current capital."
 vn_missions.8.a: "Move our seat to Königsberg"
 vn_missions.8.b: "Rather invest in [Root.Capital.GetName]"
#Byzantium
 vn_missions.9.t: "Byzantine [From.Monarch.GetTitle] Seeks Papal Support"
 vn_missions.9.d: "For centuries, the Byzantine Empire has been trotted over by internal rebellions, foreign invasions, incompetent Emperors and brutal pretenders. After the lost battle of Manzikert against the Seljuks, the Emperor lost most of his control over Anatolia, which is now ruled by Muslim invaders.\nSince the Byzantine army is in a miserable state leaded by illoyal generals, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has sent an embassy to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to ask [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] for reinforcements to combat the acute threats in [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] Empire. Although our relations have been difficult since the Great Schism, we ought to assure them our support to prevent the spread of Islam to the western side of the Bosporus."
 vn_missions.9.a: "We are still committed to Christian mercy and generosity"
 vn_missions.9.b: "The issues of the Byzantine [From.Monarch.GetTitle] are no longer our concern."
 vn_missions.9.tt: "We will send a diplomat back to Byzantium informing them of our response."
 vn_missions.10.t: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] Promises Support"
 vn_missions.10.d: "Our diplomats have returned with joyful news. Concerned about the devastating Seljuk invasion of Anatolia and the spreading of Islam, the Pope has promised his help to ward off the invaders. Although this may only be an alliance of convenience and may not resolve our religious and cultural differences, we are grateful for this required aid."
 vn_missions.10.a: "Very good!"
 vn_missions.11.t: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] Refuses Support"
 vn_missions.11.d: "Our request for support has fallen on deaf ears at [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName]! The hatred against us, caused by the recent schism, still seems to vitiate any diplomatic approaches. We will not be able to rely on the Catholic Church in the future anymore."
 vn_missions.11.a: "What a shame!"
 vn_missions.12.t: "Regnum Bospori"
 vn_missions.12.d: "Thanks to successful campaigns in recent years, we were able to claim the other side of the Black Sea coast for ourselves. Since this region was already ruled by a Roman client state in Roman times, the question now arises whether we should relinquish the local administration in order to focus our attention on other regions of our Empire."
 vn_missions.12.a: "Appoint a viceroy"
 vn_missions.12.b: "We do not need a client state"
